    <b>Stevie</b> - This recipe is awesome! It tastes just like Korea! We had it with fried dumplings and extra kim chee on the side. I didn&#039;t have Korean chile powder so I used plain was not quite as spicy as Korean but the dish was excellent - my husband loved it!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>amandaameyers</b> - Good! I did not have Kimchi on hand so I took a risk and used sauerkraut seasoned with cayenne pepper and mexican chili powder. Tasted awesome! Not a signature-Korean flavor but still very good. I also added a boiled egg and a dash of sesame oil to add another dimension of more korean-style flavor.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>buckroadeats</b> - Being that &quot;heat&quot; is a personal taste I was surprised that I didn&#039;t find this as hot as I expected. My husband who usually adds hot sauce to EVERYTHING thought it was great the way it was. My 7 yr old boys even ate it! As usual I didn&#039;t have all of the specific ingredients on hand so I used the basics of this recipe and used the veggies and meat we did have. We&#039;ll make this again.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>jewels</b> - A delicious quick and easy dish. Great to satisy a craving of something spicy &amp; flavorful. You can do without the cucumbers if you aren&#039;t into cooked cucumbers. Also I recommend cutting the kimchi up into smaller pieces. I also added sliced serrano peppers when adding the kimchi. You do not have to use a full cup of kimchi. Best to use korean red pepper flakes (different flavor &amp; texture) available at any asian market in large bags (will last a long time). The vinegar cooks off so if you are worrying about that don&#039;t. Lastly I would add more than 1 tbsp of water towards the end to keep it moist. I ended up putting about 3-4 tbsp of water. Serve immediately over hot fresh rice!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>PAMELA D. aPROpos of nothing</b> - I grated my (frozen) ginger not fond of bites of ginger. Added the carrots in with the onion and then garlic just for a minute before adding liquids. Also held back the cucumber adding it in at the end just to get it hot. Didn&#039;t have canned tuna so used Ahi.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>meshal33</b> - I just cooked this today the only thing I did different was add a tablespoon of sugar because i added a little too much vinegar and it came out really well.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Susan Clay</b> - It tasted okay. My husband thought it should be made with a different meat. He says it would be better with fresh tuna pork or chicken. I agree.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>ja</b> - I tried to stick to the recipe as much as I could but used sesame oil instaed of olive oil (more Asian) replaced the missing cukes by zucchini chunks and used Korean chili paste I had (not flakes). The result was very good but still missing something to be really great so I served the rice with mini onion green-omeletts and it helped. All in all an interesting recipe mainly because I didn&#039;t know before that tuna was used in Korean cooking:-) Shall keep trying some additions though till it will be perfect for my taste...
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>MamaMia</b> - I didnt have Kim she or cucumbers but had everything else. I substituted for garlic and ginger powder. I added some old bay seasoning and added a little chicken and shrimp.  Easy meal and healthy!
