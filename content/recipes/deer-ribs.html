    <b>Chris</b> - Great recipe. The only change was the use of a Memphis Rib Rub in lieu of the cajun seasoning. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and the ribs turned out great!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>David</b> - Great recipe. I followed the recipe as stated but added half of a banana pepper to give it a kick and would strongly suggest doing this for anyone else thinking of trying these. I also added Lawry&#039;s seasoning salt to the ribs which added flavor. One thing I would do differently is use some type of rib-rub because they came out a little dry. Other than that no complaints.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Chris</b> - I used chops as I did not get ribs from my deer. I can only imagine how amazing the ribs would be. The chops were pretty good. The apple vinegar adds a nice tartness to the vegetables and meat. Not bad would like to do this again with the ribs. Also next time I will probably substitute the oven for the slow cooker.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Ray Parker</b> - The recipe is easy to follow and did deliver on its promise of tender ribs(I cooked up a rack of mule deer ribs). I found the vinegar far too overpowering though. next time I will cut it in half or less and make up the difference with apple juice. Finishing in the oven with a sweet BBQ sauce helped a lot with the strong vinegar taste.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Linda Gilmartin</b> - Too much work for not much flavor
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Dan</b> - This recipe works very well with deer ribs. I&#039;ve made it twice now and plan to make it my default deer ribs recipe. My wife even likes it.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Shawn</b> - Loved it ,will be making more often. Gonna try a few changes just for personal taste a ease.
