    <b>MAH70</b> - Just one word - delicious!  I read through all these reviews prior to making these muffins - I thought it would be a novel way to use up our squash!  I baked the squash for an hour, then cooled it.  I used half wheat, half white flour.  And since I doubled the recipe (too much squash), I ended up using 4 cups of squash and doubled everything else.  Since my muffins were bigger, it took between 20 and 25 minutes to finish cooking the muffins.
They&#039;re moist and slightly sweet - perfect for me since I&#039;m not a huge fan of really sweet muffins.  I&#039;m not sure what went wrong for the person who wrote the negative review, but I think baking the squash definitely helped, and realize that for 12 muffins, use 1 cup of squash.

    <b>Michael Dinsmore</b> - I made changes to these muffins just like I would my pumpkin muffins to make them healthier.  Flour: 1 c all purpose, 1/4 c whole wheat and 1/4 c wheat germ.  I don&#039;t keep pumpkin pie spice on hand so I did for spices: 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ginger, 1/8 tsp allspice, 1/8 tsp cloves, 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  I also substituted 1/4 cup applesauce for the butter.  It&#039;s easier just to make pumpkin muffins, but this gives a nice change.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>MADKJ84</b> - This turned out awful! I followed the recipe precisely with no substitutes and ended up with quite a mess. I had serious misgivings when the recipe listed a 1/2 pound of cooked squash but I followed it anyway. A 1/2 pound is ALOT of squash!! There is no way that you could have weighed the squash. Did it just LOOK like a 1/2 pound to you? How about converting it to cups? I used a dietary scale and ended up with so much of the mixture it looked like I could have baked two or more pies not muffins!! I ended up actually doubling the flour/sugar mixture and adding it to what was leftover and even then I baked 24 muffins. I wanted to take them to my parents for a weekend brunch but there is no way I would serve these to anyone. I make alot of recipes that I find on Allrecipes.com but have never rated them. This is the first time I have done this because of how poorly they turned out. Never again.

    <b>CANUCKATLARGE</b> - Mmmmmmuffins! Yummy! My husband who is not a &quot;weird muffin&quot; kinda guy devoured three of these after they came out of the oven and thanked me for the nice change from our typical squash soup recipe. This is a dense moist muffin recipe and the result will disappear quickly from your table! My 8-month old son also loved them... they&#039;re not too strong tasting and very healthy. The tip for 1/2 lb of squash = 1 cup from one of the reviewers was very helpful - thanks! I also substituted half of the white flour with whole wheat (which likely contributed to the density of the muffins) and added 1/2 tsp of vanilla.

    <b>ARIAL1</b> - I made these for Thanksgiving this year and they are really yummy! The only problem was that they were really doughy... I think maybe if I would have really only filled the cups half full and baked them for about 5 minutes longer they would have been great. Watch out when you&#039;re making them though they may look done but they&#039;re probably still really doughy on the inside.

    <b>ljrd</b> - These muffins were a tasty way to use up some baked leftover squash. I just mashed it instead of pureeing it. The recipe made 30 mini muffins which took 12 minutes to bake.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>CKOWAL</b> - This was a great recipe. My first grade food science students made it. Due to what i had on hand we made a few substitutions. We used acorn instead of butternut squash. also i mixed cinnimon, ginger, and nutmeg instead of pumpkin pie spice. Next time I make it i will bake instead of boil squash. The skins come off easier and you retain a higher nutritional value.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>lorimcraw</b> - These are a wonderful way to use up leftover baked squash! Thanks to the reviewer who suggested 1 cup of squash. I sprinkled some brown sugar on top of a few muffins before baking. They were good with or without. I also substituted olive oil for the melted butter with success. I might add a bit of cinnamon or a little more pumpkin pie spice next time because the first bite or two were a little too squashy for me. Still a nice addition to my collection of muffin recipes and it was a winner with my kids.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>STEPHANIE_G</b> - I made these muffins and both myself and my huband loved them. I used nutmeg cinnamon and ginger instead of a pumpkin pie spice mix. Also I think I may have had more squash so the baking time needed to be a bit longer than 20 minutes because they were still mushy inside. But I really like these muffins and I would definitely make them again.
