    <b>Carrie Magill</b> - It&#039;s too bad somebody messed up their rating for this recipe because it&#039;s got a really terrific flavor. My only changes were to cut the recipe down to 2 servings but I still used a whole habanero (3x the listed amount) and I left in the seeds and veins. I used half the suggested amount of cilantro dried instead of fresh and broiled the chicken for 20 minutes instead of grilling. With the extra unseeded pepper this was extremely hot but still irresistable! Next time and there will be a next time I&#039;ll probably remove about half the pepper seeds and use a little less cinnamon and will definitely serve this with applesauce or something else to help cut the heat. If you aren&#039;t familiar with habaneros they&#039;re one of the hottest peppers you can get but they have a unique sweet taste that goes fantastic with chicken (and IMHO they freeze really well) so don&#039;t substitute if you can avoid it.

    <b>Nomi</b> - This recipe is AWESOME... When I found it I wanted to make it right away so I only marinated it for about 3 hrs with the chicken cut up in chunks for skewers on the grill... it tasted great with the grilled veggies. I also used jalapeno in it instead of habanero next time I will go with the habanero. My boyfriend raved about it he can&#039;t wait till we make it again. I made coconut black bean rice from this site to go with it and it paired really well.:0)

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>CrystalGayle</b> - I started to prepare this and overlooked the &quot;overnight&quot; part. I didn&#039;t have time to marinade for even half the amount of time and it still came out great! To get a milder spicy result I subbed jalapeno for habanero and didn&#039;t allow too many seeds in the mix. Combo of ingredients is so unique in the end you should taste everything the cloves cinnamon brown sugar mmmmmmm can&#039;t wait to make again! Thanks Janis!

    <b>TAS</b> - I&#039;ve been in jamaica many times and pretty much found this recipe to be quite boring. I thought the habenero&#039;s would kick it up but not really. Will look for something with more taste and will toss this one.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>S. Pettit</b> - I thought this was fantastic. I wasn&#039;t too sure of it by the smell when I was marinating it but once I put it on the grill it started smelling wonderful. My fiance ate FIVE pieces of it. The only change I made was using a jalepeno instead of a habenero. I didn&#039;t want the heat to take away from the flavor. Also make sure you marinate it for atleast 8 hours. Thanks for the recipe!

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Tabbie</b> - This marinade recipe is fantastic and so versatile! I decided to try it because I my boyfriend and I recently went to jamaica and he loved the jerk chicken. Although this is not as spicy made as it still excellent and you can make it spicy to taste. It is slightly a pain to make but has superb flavor that everyone raved about. I made a huge batch to keep some on hand so it is worth the hassle. It can even be used to make a quick and tasty pasta sauce with some added milk or cream. Thank you for the favorable recipe!

    <b>Audrey Peel</b> - I thought I&#039;d hate it since it called for cilantro but it was good and we had no leftovers which is high praise from my family. If you like cilantro than you&#039;ll love this. If you&#039;re not a fan the flavor is not overpowering. The spice combination did not overpower the meat so I wouldn&#039;t decrease the spices. And the brown sugar made a nice carmelized browning since the breasts I used were skinless. This would be good with turkey too. I found it made alot of marinade. I did up 6 breasts and I had lots leftover so I froze it. Hopefully it will keep well that way.

    <b>Cucina di papa</b> - Wonderful on the Grill careful with the Habanero it can bite!
