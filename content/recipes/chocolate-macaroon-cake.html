    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>lschepisi</b> - I was looking for a macaroon filling to use with a chocolate cake mix and this filling did work wonderfully with a box mix. I like several other reviewers miss the old Bundt Cake mixes. I have to say this will make you forget your yearning! Cathy&#039;s filling and your easy-to-do cake mix will create an awesome cake. Use the Chocolate Glaze I submitted by Jennifer to make the perfect topping for this dessert. This is a &quot;heavy duty&quot; glaze---a full-bodied flavorful change from the powdered sugar glaze I usually make.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>SUEWMASS</b> - Oh wow. Absolutely amazing. For the cake the only change I made was substituting 1/4 cup potato starch for 1/4 cup of the flour--it gives it a denser moister texture. Used unsweetened coconut in the filling mixture and put all the coconut in on top of the first half of the chocolate batter then added the rest of the chocolate batter so it gives it a tunnel-of-coconut effect. (I found it worked best to sort of mold the coconut mixture into a rope and lay it on top of the batter--it&#039;s sticky and clumpy and hard to spoon.) Instead of the frosting I made a glaze by heating 3/4 cup heavy cream and adding 6 oz bittersweet chocolate then cooling to 90 degrees and pouring it over the top of the cake.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>ENVANZAN</b> - This is a great cake. It is similar to the old chocolate macaroon Bundt mix, but it&#039;s better. I have gotten rave reviews when I&#039;ve made this. It&#039;s now my husband&#039;s favorite cake!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Ronald Kral</b> - My mother started making it for us as a special treat birthday cake every year. My wife makes it for me once a year and for our kid&#039;s birthdays. We all love it!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>PETAL251</b> - Sorry to say this recipe was a lot more trouble than it was worth. The egg whites are not easy to work with and it turned out somewhat dry and crumbly. I wanted to make something from scratch on principle but in the end I think it would&#039;ve been a better dessert if it were made with Duncan Hines. Sorry!!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>emrilwannabe</b> - thisrecipe was good but I wouldn&#039;t make it again. My family thought it was just okay and they want something else.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>georgiaFANATIC</b> - I made this for a dinner party and I have to say that I wasn&#039;t that impressed with the taste. Presentation was very nice but the cake was actually a little bland. If you like a sweet cake I don&#039;t think this is for you. It needs something although I&#039;m not sure what. I did drizzled the chocolate glaze over the cake and when that dried I drizzled warm vanilla icing over it. The icing had a marbled look. Overall I won&#039;t make it again.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>KORRIE2000</b> - The frostine is EXCELLENT but the cake isn&#039;t as good as I thought it should be for the amount of work that went into it! Very good but not spectacular.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>ARMEEN23</b> - Incredibly yummy cake. Made it for my boyfriend&#039;s birthday and even his great-baker mom loved it. Note that I don&#039;t eat refined sugar so I substituted the white sugar with evaporated cane juice I used unsweetened chocolate unsweeteneed coconut and substituted the corn syrup with a mixture of more evaporated cane juice and lowfat milk. For the novice baker (like myself) I would recommend setting aside a few hours for this cake. But it was fantastic and well worth it.
