    <b>Soup Loving Nicole</b> - This has a lovely presentation and was also pretty tasty. I didn&#039;t love the sauce. It tasted terrible on its own but actually worked okay in the finished product. I think an alfredo sauce would have been better though. I cook with white wine a lot but it just didn&#039;t seem to fit here. On the note of the sauce you&#039;ll need to double the amount the recipe calls for if you want enough for a regular size pizza. The only change I made was with the pizza dough. After a hard day at work a lengthy commute home and a stop at the grocery store I chose a refrigerated pre-made dough that was ready to fill and go. Oh and my little town grocery store was completely out of any type of fresh mushroom so I had to resort to can. Overall this was a good recipe and one I&#039;d like to play around with a bit more. You couldn&#039;t ask for a prettier looking pizza.
