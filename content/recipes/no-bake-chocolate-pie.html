    <b>SunnyDaysNora</b> - I had really high hopes for this pie- I love that the ingredients are ones that I typically have around the house and that it doesn&#039;t require heating up the oven (though it does require using the stovetop). The flavor of this pie is fine- it wasn&#039;t SUPER chocolatey and it definitely needed some whipped cream on top. There is no way that the crust would have stayed together without a few minutes in the oven. The texture turned out much closer to a loose chocolate pudding than a normal chocolate pie the slices definitely did not hold their shape when served after a night in the fridge and I definitely followed the recipe for the filling to the letter. Overall I think there are probably far better recipes out there.

    <b>Michele Collins</b> - I was nervous about trying this recipe, based on other review, BUT SO GLAD I DID!  This is now the family favorite! I followed the recipe exactly as written, and it was superb! I used my hand mixer to whisk while cooking on stove during the last 5 mins, to keep thoroughly mixed while thickening. Poured into graham cracker pie shell, covered with cling wrap, and let it completely cool before refrigerating.  The next day we were astonished by this perfect chocolate dream of a pie! I love the cocoa taste over any other chocolate, mainly due to my mom&#039;s southern homemade cooking, but not crazy about regular pie crust. This was fast and easy with the premade Keebler crust, and the best of both worlds. Thank you for the best chocolate recipe I have ever had, made, and shared!
