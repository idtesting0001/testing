    <b>Darlene</b> - I didn&#039;t want to cook my apples twice because I like my apples very chunky, so I thickened the entire can of apple juice with the cornstarch and stirred in it cinnamon.  I put the apples in the crust and just glopped the apple concentrate mixture on top and then covered it with the top crust.  I baked it for 1 hour at 350 and it turned out wonderful.  So if you don&#039;t want mushy apples, that is a good way to do it.

    <b>Jamie Hensley</b> - Carolyn, I am SOOOOO picky when it comes to apple pie.  In fact, I only like my mom&#039;s!  Hers is the standard I measure by.  Well, my aunt came to visit us last night from another state, and she is diabetic, so I skeptically looked up no-sugar-added recipes.  I saw how great your reviews were, so I decided to make it.  FANTASTIC!  Just as the other comments said, not only did she like it, so did everyone else!  My dad and husband are just as loyal to my mom&#039;s apple pie as me, but they both said this was AWESOME!  I hope you have more recipes like this one :)
Note:  I used my Mom&#039;s &quot;Never Fail Pie Crust&quot; recipe, which is the BEST.  I will post it on this site!

    <b>COOKIEKRUMBS</b> - Yummy.  This turned out great.  The only thing is my Husband is a diabetic and the concentrated juice is also considered a very high sugar so I decided to try it with just regular apple juice and it still turned out great.  Oh ya I also used Mac Apples instead of green ones (green ones are a little too tart for me). Thanks for the recipe. I&#039;m going to try it with other fruits!!  I also made sure to put it into a cholesterol free pie crust so it was low in cholesterol too.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>KATEFACE</b> - This pie tastes good, but I don&#039;t believe it is a very wise choice for diabetics.  At 53.7g of carbs per serving, a diabetic might as well have a couple of chocolate bars.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>chibi chef</b> - I&#039;d love to give this 5 stars for not using butter in the filling but while it was good for a healthier recipe it didn&#039;t wow me. I used super sweet Fuji apples instead of Granny Smiths and I&#039;m glad I did because the pie was a bit tart even with the sweeter apples. FYI: the body metabolizes fructose (fruit sugar) the same way as sucrose (table sugar). So while BOTH INCREASE BLOOD SUGAR fructose is generally preferred because they usually come along with good stuff like fiber and vitamins while things made sugar are usually processed and lacking nutritional value (i.e. apples vs cake).

    <b>Katherine Silvester</b> - I love this apple pie. I make it with apple cider instead of apple concentrate and it is awesome! My entire family begs for it. Just be careful of the amount of apple cider or the pie will boil over like crazy. Cook it on a cookie sheet. This is the only apply pie that I make now.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Amber</b> - This is a fantastic recipe! I made it initially some time last year in the fall and I&#039;ve not used another recipe since. Everybody who&#039;s ever tried this has given it rave reviews and I love it so much that this is my default pie. (I&#039;ve made it at least 15 times!) I bake it every one to two weeks and it barely lasts a couple days at most. I usually try and use at least three different types of apples but always at least two. This adds to the flavor of the pie. I always use Granny Smith and either Jonagold or Empire or both. I also add more cinnamon at least half a tablespoon more. Delicious pie!

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Dawn Turner</b> - Fantastic!!!! This is the best sugar free dessert I have ever eaten!!! increase the cinnamon or add nutmeg for an extra punch of flavor
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Mariam</b> - I was very sceptical in making this pie at first. I was sure it was going to be too sour because of the lack of sugar. But it is amazing how wrong i was! My mom who usually always wants things extra sweet said that it was the perfect pie! My family couldn&#039;t believe that it had no sugar in it! I used no sugar added granny smith apple cocentrate and granny smith and royal gala apples for the filling. When filling the crust with the apples make sure to remove the apples from the syrup because if you add too much syrup in with them it will leak a lot while baking. I used the best ever pie crust recipe on this site. Very easy to make and turned out great! Thank you for this recipe awesome!
