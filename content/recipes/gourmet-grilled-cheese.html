    <b>Richelle Linee&#039; Coursey Kehe</b> - This recipe is so unbelievable good! My husband and I were in heaven! The recipe didn&#039;t specify what kind of bread to use so we got a fresh baked italian loaf sliced and used that. This sandwich is great just the way it is. Next time we might add some fresh spinach to the sandwich but it certainly doesn&#039;t need it.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>SunnyByrd</b> - First there is the 5 star crispy-cheesy grilled romano on the bread. Then there is the creamy-tomatoey stuff inside. THEN there are the hundreds of variations you can do with this recipe. We did some with fresh herbs, some with pesto, one with colby-jack &amp; blue cheese. The one in the picture is as written on sourdough. Yum. Thanks for the recipe(s)!!!

    <b>string of pearls</b> - Very good but it could have been more flavorful. I do love a good gourmet grilled cheese sandwich!

    <b>gderr the dysfunctional</b> - excellent! i did it a little different for taste. i used fresh shredded mozz cheese skipped the egg step and fried in @2 tbls butter added fresh basil chopped and dry italian seasonings as well as fresh ground sea salt and black pepper. this sandwich screams for some bacon or ham. great with veggie soup on a cool evening. a true gourmet cheese sandwich! update... i ADDED mozz cheese to this and now some pepperjack cheese. excellent!

    <b>MeggieK</b> - BEST grilled cheese sandwich ever! I crave it almost too much:) I add spinach and italian herb blend then cook it on the george forman grill and it is delicious!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Erin</b> - My son LOVED this recipe. Says a lot coming from a six year old! (Oh we loved it too!)
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>CRAZY4SUSHI</b> - I made a few using the egg dip method but didn&#039;t like how it really didn&#039;t crisp up enough. So I used butter instead then dipped in the cheese. So much better. So many ways to make this your own creation. The kids like fontina better than goat.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>b&#039;s lady</b> - used parmasean instead of romano. granny smith apples instead of tomatoes
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>lesliezientek</b> - If I were to make this again I would use less goat cheese. It was very rich but it tasted pretty good with tomato soup.
