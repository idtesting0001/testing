    <b>lutzflcat</b> - 3.1.18 I used The Last Caesar Salad Recipe You ll Ever Need on this site for the dressing (which on its own is fabulous!). My husband and I enjoyed this today for lunch and we both thought it was absolutely delicious. I know the caesar salad dressing may sound totally outside-the-box for saucing a pizza but it just seems to blend in perfectly and doesn t overpower the other flavors. As a side comment I can see feta cheese working as well as the goat cheese and it would crumble even better. I think the next time I ll cook my bacon just until it s almost done and allow it to crisp up all the way when it s in the oven and then the broiler. I can see this coming as a summer dinner with a really nice side salad. Diana53 thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe.
