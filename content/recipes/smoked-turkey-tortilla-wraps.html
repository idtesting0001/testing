    <b>MAGGIE MCGUIRE</b> - Yummy lunch idea, June! We love these with shredded lettuce, finely chopped tomato, and thinly slice cucumber. Great!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>MELISSALACAILLE</b> - This recipe works great for hot evenings and a quick dinner. I add chunks of cucumber for a fresh taste. This recipe works really well as a appetizer by slicing wrap into small pieces and holding together with toothpicks.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Jillian</b> - Delicious! Perfect when you just don&#039;t feel like cooking dinner! I used flour tortillas because that&#039;s what I had on hand. I added a little sliced tomato and some shredded lettuce.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>schmerna</b> - I used fresh spinach instead of avacado great for lunch.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>GOCLCLESS</b> - Very good! I used homemade guacamole &amp; bacon to add an extra smokey zip!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>KIMMYKUP</b> - What a fabulous lunch I&#039;m having today! I made just one for myself and it&#039;s delicious! The sun-dried tomato pesto and cream cheese really make this wrap. I used smoked deli turkey swiss cheese tomatoes shredded romaine and red onions. I wish I had made two! Thanks for this recipe!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>JULIESATCH</b> - This was fast and easy. I didn&#039;t cook the tortillas cause it makes them hard. I like the soft ones-use the big burrito kind. Bring salsa to dip and buy more than one avacado.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>MELISSADAVIS1</b> - This was fabulous even with lite sour cream and lofat cheese...mixed the salsa and sour cream and used as a dressing inside the wrap and used spinach instead of avocado....great Weight Watchers lunch!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>SweetBasil</b> - Since we smoked our turkey this year I thought these would be a good change from the usual sandwiches the day after. Added the salsa right to the sour cream with a little extra garlic salt also some shredded lettuce - Yum!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Mom22GreatKids</b> - I wasn&#039;t too impressed by this. Not enough flavor by itself. When you add other ingredients it turns out pretty tasty. I only gave it 3 stars since I had to add so much.
    </li>
        </ul>
