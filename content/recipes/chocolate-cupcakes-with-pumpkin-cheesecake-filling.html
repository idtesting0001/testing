    <b>Scott R</b> - I was liberal on the pumpkin portion. It made for a good flavour. When putting the batter in the muffin trays I made the first batch as directed. All the cheese cake filling stayed on top. Second batch I added a lot less cake batter then filling with more cake batter over top. This gave a better look and more mixture throughout the cupcake.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Iola Small</b> - Yes some had peanut butter icing with candies.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Donna Nickell Hancock</b> - We liked the recipe but the pumpkin flavor was not there. These just tasted like a large Black Bottom...which we love. I plan to make them again adding more pumpkin puree or maybe some pumpkin spice.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Victoria Jenkins</b> - u used a dark chocolate duncan hines cake mix and added more pumpkin.
