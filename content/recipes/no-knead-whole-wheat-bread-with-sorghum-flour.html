recipeinstructions:
- "Dissolve yeast in 1 1/2 cups lukewarm water in a small bowl. Let stand until bubbly, about 5 minutes."
- "Mix 2 cups whole wheat flour, sorghum flour, and salt in a large plastic container with a lid. Stir in yeast mixture with a wooden spoon, adding more water if dough is not evenly moistened. Cover with a lid and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in volume, about 2 hours."
- "Dust a cutting board with 1 tablespoon whole wheat flour. Turn the dough out onto the board and briefly knead with your hands. Shape into a round loaf.

Place dough in the bowl and cover with the ends of the dish towel; let rise until nearly doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours."
