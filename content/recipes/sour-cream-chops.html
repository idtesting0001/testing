    <b>Laura Palka</b> - I&#039;m in love! First off, I usually stink at making pork chops. This is the first recipe I&#039;ve found where the chops didn&#039;t turn out like dry shoe leather. In this recipe they are as moist as meat can be. The sauce is so flavorful. The basil makes this dish (I substituted about 2 tsp dry basil). The recipe was simple to make. You could probably throw in an extra chop or two since it makes ample sauce. I wouldn&#039;t suggest making any other substitutions, as this recipe is perfect as-is (except, I&#039;m sure it would also be great with chicken).

    <b>GRDNMOM</b> - I made this in the crockpot so I didn&#039;t heat up the kitchen.I browned the pork first.My whole family loved it!!!!We have some picky eaters too.I will use this recipe again.It&#039;s very easy and quick and tastes amazing!!
    </li>

    <b>lil&#039; menehune</b> - Yumm....My husband loved this dish. I&#039;ve made it twice this week. The combination of onion garlic basil mushrooms and tomatoes really perk up plain old pork chops. It tastes great even without sour cream. I&#039;ve used thick cut pork chops and pork cutlets and they both turned out wonderful. If you use pork cutlets reduce your cooking time in half. Definitely a keeper! Thanks Lisa Dawn

    <b>KimberlyKay</b> - Very tasty dish. I made it with 2 pork chops and 2 chicken breasts in the same pan and they all turned out great! Didn&#039;t need full hour of simmering to cook through but neither meat toughened while I left it on the stove to stay warm.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Sarah</b> - The pork turned out tasty and tender. The only thing I did different is double the garlic. This is a keeper! DEEELISH!

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>DELTAQUEEN50</b> - I thought this was Ok. My family ate it but weren&#039;t overly impressed. I thought it was rather bland. If I were to make it again I would eliminate the milk as I found the sauce a little runny and I would also boost the seasonings a little.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Pam Potter</b> - These turned out moist and tender but were otherwise bland and lacking depth. We ate them but I don&#039;t think I will bother with them again.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Melissa Hofer Adam</b> - I feel awful that I&#039;m in the minority here maybe I did something wrong I was quite surprised that it didn&#039;t have more flavor than it did. Although my pork chops were nice and tender I wasn&#039;t really impressed with the sauce. It may have been the cream of chicken maybe the brand I used I&#039;m just not sure I followed the recipe to a &#039;T&#039; and thought I&#039;d love it. My husband enjoyed it but he will generally eat anything.:) Sorry that I&#039;m in the minority! Maybe I&#039;ll try it again and see what happens.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>KADELL22</b> - Oh my gosh...fabulous! Only change I made was to use more soup for extra gravy but used cream of mushroom and cream of celery instead of chicken based. The fresh tomato especially since they&#039;re in season added just the right texture. And the basil was the perfect seasoning. I will make these again and again. Thanks for the new twist on chops!
