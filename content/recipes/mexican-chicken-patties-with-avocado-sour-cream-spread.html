    <b>Ron D</b> - Ive been making these burgers for at least 3 years and the only  tweak i make is useing a little less Chipotle than the recipe calls for.  My family loves these but my personal preference is less Chipotle.    Please don&#039;t tell them because they love Chipotle and would recommend I use the full tablespoon.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Soup Loving Nicole</b> - These were excellent! I think the amount of green onion is a bit much. 2 would be plenty. The chipotle powder gives this quite a kick. My only change is that for the spread I blended guacamole with sour cream so that there would be more flavor. Again these were excellent and I bet it would be good would ground chicken and ground beef too.
