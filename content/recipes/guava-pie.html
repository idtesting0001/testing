    <b>Debsart</b> - Fast and Easy! The ingredients complimented the fruit well. On the next batch of pies I added a 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon then precooked 2 cups of fruit and thickened using 1/4 cup water to 1/3 cup flour, bring to a rolling boil stirring constantly. Remove from heat and cool approx. 10 mins., build pie as above less 2 cups fruit. Lastly add precooked fruit mixture, lemon, juice and butter cubes, cover with crust and cook per directions. This makes the pie thick and easy to serve.

    <b>tms</b> - Delicious pie will make it again used tapioca and used Splenda and subtracted 1/2 the sugar. Eating the pie with melted cheese was superb

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>belshers</b> - Followed the recommendation of a previous reviewer and upped the cinnamon an additional 1/2 tsp. I would also recommend some flour in the pie to thicken the juices. Turned out wonderful. I did cheat an add 1 gala apple in because I was getting tired of cutting and deseeding guava. Glad I did because I realized I&#039;m not a big fan of Guava. I also subbed 1/2 cup in place of the 1/2 sugar. All turned out great!

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Niko Darling</b> - I didn&#039;t use flour because  of a gluten allergy so I just substituted with an egg.I also dubled the cinimon because I didn&#039;t have nutmeg.
