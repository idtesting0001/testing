    <b>vbzia</b> - TEMPERATURE ALERT!!!  this recipe really needs to be edited, the temp is listed way too high.  i had to scrap mine and make french toast for the kids instead...i used to make a smaller amount version of this pancake in a skillet, and believe me its one of the most interesting, easiest breakfasts out there.  im definetly going back to this one, but next time with a lower temp.. 
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Margcamp</b> - I accidently made this the first time in a 9x9 pan and it was burnt on the edges and raw in the middle.  The second time I noticed the 9x13 indicated in the recipe and the results were great...delicous and a nice change from regular pancakes.  I added some vanilla to the batter and baked at 400 for almost 40 minutes to avoid burning, as recommended by others.  Served with choices of syrup, mixed fruit, or powdered sugar...all of which were great accompaniments.

    <b>Tabitha King</b> - SOOOOO GOOOD!  I haven&#039;t been able to find a homeaide pancake recipe that I like, so I decided to try something new and I went with this recipe and man am I glad I did!  I took the suggestions from other reviewers and baked it at 400 for 40 minutes and it turned out perfect :)  Thanks for a great recipe, it is going to be hard to make regular pancakes from here on out, lol.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Mitsue</b> - beat by hand, cut recipe down to feed 8 and baked in a cast Iron skillet. I cooked it for 20 minutes at 400 and it&#039;s perfect. Just perfect. Bearing in mind that everyone&#039;s oven can be different, I opted for a lower temp because I can always cook it longer if necessary. I suggest that you use your best judgment when you go to bake it. I topped it with blueberry preserves and it was a great hit. I&#039;ll make this regularly!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Mary Hall Payne</b> - I am sooo excited!  My muma made this for me when I was a child.  I&#039;ve always wanted the recipe but never knew how to spell it! lol!  She died when I was only 9 so I couldn&#039;t ask her.  Thank you so much it will bring back such wonderful memories!

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>chellebelle</b> - I learned to make this a long time ago from a friend&#039;s mother. It is even better with blueberries stirred into the batter. You can reduce the sugar by quite a bit as well.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>AWO</b> - This was definitely good, but the fifth star is because it was so easy rather than for taste.  I&#039;d never had Kropser before, so I have no basis for comparison.  It seemed to me like a cross between a very firm custard and a popover.  As written, I thought there was too much butter - melted butter pooled on the top and its flavor dominated.  The second time I halved the butter (2 TBSP) and liked it much more.  The edges puffed up really high, but the middle stayed flat like a basket, so you can fill with fruit for an attractive presentation.  Maple syrup was also good, and I cut up some of the flat middle section into small squares, topped with jam, and served them like cakes.  It was good both hot and cold!

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Glenda</b> - This turned out as good as the other reviewers said it was. It did burn some on the edges even with the temp turned to *425. My family loved it with or w/out powered sugar and syrup.It&#039;s nothing like a pancake. It is thick with hills and valleys and a creamy texture. Very, Very yummy.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Heather D</b> - Made this for dinner-for-breakfast because I am terrible with fried pancakes, and my husband begged for it for breakfast that weekend. It made a &quot;crust&quot; on the top and bottom around the custardy middle, so good! I used half white / half wheat flour so it was dense but delicious. I also altered the temp as other reviewers have suggested.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>patiencens</b> - This recipe needs serious editing for a 9x13 dish this is too much it overflows and still seems eggy. 450 degrees is also way too hot my first batch burned horribly around the edges while not finished in the center. It also should have vanilla extract in there it seems its not sweet like it should be.
