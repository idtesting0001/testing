- "1 ⅓ cups milk"
- "½ teaspoon vanilla extract"

recipeinstructions:
- "Place rice, salt, and water into a saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat; sprinkle with sugar and pour in milk. Stir with a whisk until until the thin layer of cooked-on starch at the bottom of the pan is cleared and incorporated into the mixture, 2 or 3 minutes."

    <b>SHORECOOK</b> - EXCELLENT!   I watched the video.  It made it so quick and easy to make.  The amount of sweetness was just right.  My only change was that I used vanilla bean paste.  It was the perfect finish to tonight&#039;s dinner.  Thank you Chef John for sharing another EXCELLENT recipe!  You never let us down!

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Elma</b> - Made it exactly like the recipe and loved it.

    <b>ScratchBakerCR</b> - Sweet, creamy goodness perfect for that sweet tooth! 

It had been awhile since I had made any dessert  and I was craving something sweet.  I didn&#039;t want to make cookies or cake or pie so I thought I&#039;d look to see what I could find that was different than the usual.  When I signed in I saw this recipe on the main page and immediately thought, THAT&#039;S IT!  That&#039;s what I&#039;m gonna make!

62 years old and I have never made rice pudding before, even though I always liked it so wasn&#039;t sure how it was going to turn out.   It was fabulous and SO easy!   One pot is all you need and Chef John was right, it did NOT stick to the pot at all so no need to use that second pot that other recipes call for.  The only change I made was to use raisins instead of the cherries.  

 I will definitely be making this again!

    <b>Suzq</b> - Oh my goodness, this is the BEST rice pudding! I didn&#039;t realize how much I missed it! So good that I doubled the recipe and made the doubled recipe three times in one week (I shared, I swear). I used Arborio rice instead of long grain white, because that&#039;s what I had. I also left the cinnamon out because I like to sprinkle it and nutmeg (oh, the nutmeg!) on top. I found that turning off the heat while the pudding was still a little soupy and letting it sit for a bit made the consistency perfect, whether shortly after cooling enough to eat without burning yourself or out of the refrigerator the next day. Sooo good, and makes me feel like a kid again. :-)

    <b>Vicky Welch</b> - Love, love, love!  I used about a cup of leftvoer white rice we had from Chinese food!  We always have plain white rice left over from Chinese take out.  This is a great, easy way to use it! And I always love Chef John&#039;s recipes and tips. Thank you!

    <b>katyggls</b> - I&#039;ve made this recipe several times now, and it is the best rice pudding I&#039;ve ever had. I will pretty much only use this recipe from now on. Comes out very creamy and rich. It&#039;s also super easy to make and I love that it only takes one pot. Don&#039;t be afraid of the egg trick here. As long as you stir in the egg yolk fast with the heat off, you aren&#039;t going to have scrambled egg in your pudding, trust me. The first time I made it I followed the recipe to the letter. It was perfect. In subsequent tries, I&#039;ve made it with part heavy cream instead of all milk, which gave it a little added richness. I&#039;ve also used other dried fruit like raisins and cranberries. You can also vary the flavoring, like almond extract instead of vanilla, or nutmeg instead of cinnamon.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>sellis</b> - Delicious and simple.  I used golden raisins and will try the cherries next time.  There will definitely be a next time.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Gay Hammitt</b> - Made this exactly as written and enjoyed it very much.  Used jasmine rice, 1% milk and sugar.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Tracey Martinelli-English</b> - I made this and I didn&#039;t cook the rice long enough - my bad. But the flavor was incredible. I plan on making it again soon. It is a bit time consuming as you have to continuously stir which always takes some effort for me as I am constantly moving around the kitchen.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Jennifer Perrino</b> - It was tasty but for my first time I will say it was easy but it was not cooked enough.  I didn’t trust myself, I should have cooked the rice longer in part 2, as the rice was definitely too aldente.
