- "Cook peppers under the preheated broiler until the skin has blackened and blistered, about 5 minutes."
- "While peppers are cooking, place portobello mushroom caps into a resealable plastic bag. Pour in balsamic vinaigrette, squeeze out excess air, and seal. Marinate in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight."
- "Remove blackened peppers from the oven, transfer to a bowl, and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Allow peppers to steam as they cool, about 20 minutes. Once cool, remove and discard skins. Refrigerate 8 hours to overnight."

- "To assemble the sandwiches, spread all 8 slices of focaccia bread with a thin layer of ranch dressing. Layer 1/2 of the bread slices with a slice of Swiss cheese, an eggplant slice, a roasted pepper half, a portobello mushroom cap, and a slice of Asiago cheese. Top with the remaining bread."
- "Spray the double-sided grill with cooking spray, and cook the sandwiches until the cheese has melted, the sandwiches are hot in the center, and the bread is golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes."

    <b>Ana Nino</b> - My boyfriend and I made it all in one day since I didn&#039;t realized you needed to marinate the mushrooms over night. I was still AMAZING! Defiantly having it again.

    <b>Muzette Mercer</b> - I absolutely love this recipe. I&#039;m vegetarian and not a very good cook and this recipe turned out fantastic. Even meat lovers in my family love it!

    <b>Sabah Siddiqui</b> - i used mozzarella cheese instead of the cheese suggested and it came out extremely good. Overall a great recipe. My husband and I loved it!!

    <b>France C</b> - So much wonderful flavor in this sandwich...but it&#039;s very time consuming.  To save time, I would just buy roasted red peppers (in a jar) and use those next time. So many bold flavors that all compliment each other perfectly. I thought the eggplant and mushroom could use a a sprinkle of salt. The sandwich is a little hard to eat because everything tends to slide off the bread, but the flavor is worth it.
