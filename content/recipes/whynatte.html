    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Kuniansky</b> - A little bit questionable in theory but one of the better cocktails I&#039;ve ever had. For best results use a fresh hot latte. Worth a try especially if you like coffee.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Kevin</b> - This one is sort of like a cross between a Jager Bomb and a Timmy&#039;s run (Tim Horton&#039;s for the uninformed - or Starbucks if you MUST)... Perhaps it should be renamed the &quot;Great White North Jager Bomb&quot;;);)
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Yoly</b> - You have to like Jagermeister to like this hot coffee drink. With that said I don&#039;t particularly care for it but we were gifted a bottle recently. Very similar to the drink where a shot of Jager is dropped into a glass full of Red Bull energy drink. I happen to like that one better. Thank you for the recipe.
