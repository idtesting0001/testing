    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>raelliott</b> - I used spinach instead of cabbage because I had it on hand tastes wonderful.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Qijdi Goldwing</b> - I doubled the batch added a pinch of scotch bonnet hot sauce (Sriracha will do) and DEFINITELY used light brown not black soy and No pepper.. The store did not have any bok choy so I had to settle for fresh brussels sprouts... Believe it or not?? The peeled leaves of a few worked perfectly and were not too strong in flavor. I used a whole carrot and shredded instead of julienne. I also used 1 large clove of garlic and added a pinch of basil. I polished it off with 3 eggs instead of 2 and gave it a touch of pepper spiced vinegar ( rice vinegar preferred ). It was magnificent.. This recipe is very good but has some development needed.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Ron Lloyd</b> - Tastes good but too much stuff in it for me. I would rather have the simpler version.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Lexi King</b> - I even chopped up two celery sticks and added them it was great will definitely be making this again
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>ICanBoilWater</b> - My daughter wanted Egg Drop Soup like the soup at her favorite Chinese restaurant. I used a dash of ground ginger in place of fresh ginger and added a dash of granulated garlic. I doubled the cabbage added frozen peas &amp; reduced cornstarch to 1/2 tsp. It was just like the restaurant! I will definitely make this again!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Doug Dahlin</b> - I did not have ginger but without it was great
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Naomi Joy</b> - I added a little fish sauce and grated garlic - yummy!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Jay-vz</b> - Came out really bland had to add lots of salt.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Madeline Gorge</b> - Very bland although that may have been the broth. Will add more carrots water chestnuts and mini corn next time as well as experiment with different broths.
