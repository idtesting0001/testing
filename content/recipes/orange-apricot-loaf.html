        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Valerie Harlan</b> - A Enjoyed this bread very much. It had great flavor. I made it exactly as the recipe called for. The only thing I&#039;ll do differently next time is add more apricots. And thats only because I prefer more fruit in my fruit breads.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>pelicangal</b> - I made this recipe to give it a face for the AllRecipes Allstars challenge. Very easy to make. I took it to work and everyone really liked it. A couple of people said that it seemed a little flat. May have to tweak a little next time.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Justquilting</b> - I was not overly thrilled with this loaf. My husband wasn&#039;t either. It was a bit dry and seems to either be missing something or the existing ingredients don&#039;t meld together just right. Unless you enjoy a very lightly sweetened fruit bread you might want to try it. Otherwise I&#039;m sure there are better choices. My kids would not even touch this.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>KEZ</b> - One daughter doesn&#039;t like raisins and the other doesn&#039;t like dried apricots but they both liked this. I didn&#039;t chop the raisins but otherwise stuck to the recipe exactly. One word of warning I sliced this whilst still warm and it crumbled but once cold it was fine. Thanks.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Thrasher</b> - Good tasting bread but I had to bake it for 1 hour before it was done. I find the recipe too sweet though next time I will use half the sugar. Instead of 1/2 cup raisins I used 1/4 cup raisins and 1/4 cup tropical mix dried fruit.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>carmen</b> - JUST MADE THIS LOAF YUMMY!! NEXT TIME I MAKE IT WILL CHOP THE APRICOTS SMALLER
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>RUBY2</b> - I made this to serve at a brunch as a not-too-sweet addition to the bread tray. Everyone liked it. I didn&#039;t get 1 TBSP of zest from my small orange so added a bit of natural orange extract to the batter to bump up the orange flavor. I used more apricots so also added an extra splash of o.juice. My loaf needed 50 minutes in the oven. As an alternative next time I will increase the butter by 2-3 TBSP to keep it moist maybe add some Cointreau to the dried fruit and o.j. mixture possibly increase the sugar slightly to make it more of a cake rather than a loaf
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>amberwigg</b> - It needs salt! And Baking powder or soda or whatever one helps things rise. It was flat and hard. I can see how it could be yummy with the addition of a few things.
    </li>
        </ul>
