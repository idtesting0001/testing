    <b>Cindy in Pensacola</b> - The taste with my changes makes this a 10 star recipe but as is, only 4.  I slice my carrots and simmer for about 8 minutes to slightly soften.  I boiled the vinegar with the sugar and took it off the stove and added the white onion &amp; jalepeno (I used jarred, not fresh).   When the carrots were to my liking I scooped them into the vinegar mixture and let that set for 1 hour.  I then put into 2 1-pint jars and will refrigerate.  I did also add some salt as I think it needs that.  YUMMMO!!

    <b>maria r s</b> - I made the recipe but added about 1 heaping tspn of dried oregano,4 cloves of crushed garlic,and a tspn of whole peppercorns to the boiled vinigar/sugar mixture! Yummy and totally tastes the same as the resturants

    <b>Duckball</b> - We had some jalapenos that were starting to get a little old, so I found and tried this recipe. It is fantastic. I had only had the pickled peppers in restaurants, and these are so much better. To the vinegar and sugar, I added several shakes of ground pepper, around 1/4 tsp of Italian seasoning, and a few shakes of salt. I boiled my carrots for around five minutes before adding the peppers (quartered lengthwise into strips, with the membrane and seeds removed). I also added three cloves of garlic, quartered, and maybe 1/4 cup of sliced white onion. I only boiled everything together for a couple minutes, and then I let it all cool in the pot. When at room temperature, into a glass jar! So good, next time I want to add some cauliflower! Don&#039;t be scared of making pickled anything. The reward is worth the effort! Thanks for sharing, JC!

    <b>SweetBasil</b> - Whole family loves these. I always add about a tsp of oregano to the pickling liquid as that&#039;s how I remember them on the table at our favorite Mexican restaurant in San Diego. They keep in the fridge for about 2 weeks if they&#039;re around that long.

    <b>Tania D.</b> - Since I wanted to use these hot peppers to decorate a meat dish I left them whole and added various other hot peppers. They are beautiful and very tasty!

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>MattOlay V-H</b> - Easy! Made this just for my husband and he enjoyed them. I didn&#039;t have jalapeño so I used the left over yellow peppers. Also added salt and oregano.

    <b>ramonan</b> - i must of done something wrong. Carrots are still too crispy. Too sugary also. Too bad. I live in San Diego and eat these all the time....
