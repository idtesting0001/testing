    <b>LONGWRO</b> - I made this for a baby shower and it was a Hit! It is so easy and can be made the night before and then heated when needed. For a party make a double batch. Great with crackers or toasted baquette slices. The recipe references 3 green onions but doesn&#039;t say whether to sprinkle on top or incorporate into the dip. I stirred them into the dip and they added color and flavor.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>KAJONES0129</b> - This spread was a hit at the holiday gathering. It stayed fairly creamy even as it cooled and did not separate. I thought my swiss cheese was not very flavorful so I added a dash of seasoned salt. Also added more almonds. I can also envision adding dried cranberries. Very good will make again!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>GINNYG</b> - Made this for Thanksgiving...was wonderful. I could have easily eaten the whole bowl for dinner...:)
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>SANDYNSACTO</b> - I have made this for a number of parties in the last few months and it has been a BIG hit. I have been asked to make it again but this time to double the recipe. The only thing I changed was that I added a dash of salt. Fabulous!!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>dutchkidzx2</b> - I just made this for a family party and every single person loved it! I served it with sesame melba toasts and it was delicious!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>beth</b> - If you heat too long the cheese gets very stringy and the oil separates.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>TFLOWER6</b> - This recipe had a lovely flavor... but it was so thick and gloppy it could hardly be removed from the bowl... and spreading on crackers was not easy. If I make this again I will spread it on toasted baguette slices while it is still hot.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>lovin vanilla</b> - too cheesy very strong onion flavour and basically tasted just like melted cheese. way too rich! will not make again!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>mickeymouse</b> - I had this at a party recently and it was delicious - the person who made it omitted the onions and topped it with crushed bacon.
    </li>
        </ul>
