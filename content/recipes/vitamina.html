    <b>Li Shu</b> - I didn&#039;t have any milk (substituted water) and it stil came out great.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>x0xmandaxpandax0x</b> - I used ice cream instead of the sweet milk and frozen mango chunks with a few frozen mixed berries and it tasted just like something i would get at orange julius
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>FRAMBUESA</b> - There&#039;s not way this would have made 5 servings for me but it was still pretty good. I ended up adding ice to mine to make it more of a batida I guess but it would have been good without it...just not cold like I like my drinks.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Bogdwell</b> - Similar to the Vitamina I have had.. but TOO sweet!!I cut the condensed milk by 2/3.. (depending on the sweetness of the mango) but otherwise a tasty treat that makes me think of Sao Paulo.. Saudades Muito!!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>coraskitchen</b> - Wonderful... it was a little chunky and VERY sweet though...
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Sunny</b> - Much too sweet. This only made 2 servings... not 5. My mangoes might have been bad I don&#039;t know. It turned greyish yellow and was very pulpy.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Kim&#039;s Cooking Now</b> - I made this two ways - as a drink and as an ice cream! Because I wanted the ice cream to have a creamy mouth feel I used a combination of milk and heavy cream instead of just milk. Both were very good but I preferred it as ice cream - maybe because it&#039;s been so hot and humid here in Georgia that it just hit the spot after our Thai dinner tonight! Delicious!
