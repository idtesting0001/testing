    <b>kimberly</b> - I really like moist cake so I enjoyed this recipe. However I thought it was missing something so I added a cinnamon strudel on top. Delicious!!! I made the strudel by adding 1/3 cup packed brown sugar 2 tablespoons all purpose flour 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon and 1 tablespoon butter.

    <b>Caroline C</b> - 9/7/06 I couldn&#039;t believe how quick easy and delicious this cake turned out! It took absolutely no time to make and was so moist and flavorsome (I used cherry pie filling). It will without doubt be a staple in my house in the future. Thanks Joyce! 1/10/07 Made this again yesterday with a can of peach pie filling. It was still very good but not as sweet as I would have liked. I would recommend adding more sugar with this particular fruit.

    <b>Debby S.</b> - This is a grest recipe with some &quot;tweaking&quot;; hence the 4 star rating.  Others reviewers have complained of blandness, so here ishow I boosted the flavor factor.  I use 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup melted butter (instead of oil) and 1 (6 ox) container of yogurt (same flavor as pie filling used), 1 1/2 cups freash fruit added to the pie filling.  So for Blueberry Pied Cake I use blueberry yogurt and 1 1/2 cups fresh blueberries and I onit the cinnamon.  For Cherry Pie Cake, cheery yogurt and fresh or frozen cherries and I omit the cinnamon and use almond extract instead of vanilla.  Strawberry Pie Cake is delicious too!  You get the idea.  This is a very versatile recipe and that&#039;s why I like it! I get rave reviews every time I&#039;ve served my version of Pie Cake.  It&#039;s great for breakfast or dessert!

    <b>Dana</b> - This cake was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly...leaving out the nuts...It was extremely moist. My husband had 4 pieces the first day!

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>MELLYMAMA</b> - We used a can of blueberries and this was a hit (even with my mother-in-law who usually only likes chocolate desserts). I don&#039;t know what fruit the person who said this cake turned out dry used because I&#039;ve never had a more moist cake. Very easy moist light and delicious. A little scoop of ice cream compliments this well. Thank you Joyce!

    <b>VIRGOVICKY</b> - pie cake is so good and couldn&#039;t be simpler. it&#039;s great warm with ice cream but it also makes a really good sancking cake. it&#039;s great with apple but i ahven&#039;t tried any others yet.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>CHICHIBIRD</b> - I think this recipe is wonderful!! I had to make a couple changes. I didn&#039;t have walnuts so I used pecans instead. I left out the cinnamon which I figured I wouldl like in apple but I used cherry pie filling and added 1/2 teaspoon pure almond extract. It baked up beautifully and is sooooo moist and good. I will definitely be using this recipe a lot. So quick and easy! Thank you for sharing it.

    <b>Laura</b> - Quick and yummy. Using strawberry filling gives it a very PINK look! Missing from the instructions: Turn the cake out of the pan when it has cooled a while.

    <b>Tom Wyant</b> - I made this cake exactly as the directions were written using blueberry pie filling istead of cherry. It is a very moist cake and couldn&#039;t be easier to make. We enjoyed it very much with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>COOKIN4MYFAMILY</b> - One of the keys to getting the best result with this recipe is to choose a really good quality canned pie filling since it is such a large part of the batter. I used a store brand blueberry flavor and the filling itself was rather bland (I tasted a little out of the can after I made the recipe). Maybe the extra fruit pie filling would be a better choice. Also blueberry makes an unappetizing color of batter so I decided at the last minute to use a streusel topping to cover up the gray color. I would recommend using a topping and the optional nuts to make this cake more interesting. It came out a little too moist even baking it for a full 60 minutes. This was good my teenager liked it but not my favorite.
