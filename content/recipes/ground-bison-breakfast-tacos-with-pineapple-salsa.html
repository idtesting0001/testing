    <b>Paula</b> - I loved using bison for this recipe. It surprisingly tasted like ground chuck with fewer calories and half the fat. However I would have preferred a stronger taco seasoning rather than the spices listed. I was a little hesitant about using the scrambled eggs but they were barely discernible. The pineapple salsa was fantastic even though I left out the cilantro (my husband hates it) and used only half of the jalapeno (I&#039;m a heat wimp). I can see this salsa on fish and will make it again. I will definitely buy bison again.

    <b>Marianne</b> - We would give the salsa on this a 5 and the taco on this a 4. The taco itself needed a little more flavor and no matter how good the salsa was it couldn&#039;t make up for that. We really liked how the bison cooked up and how fresh it tastes. I did add quite a bit of seasoning to this---especially using Tajin which was a good flavor enhancer for this recipe! I would try this again! Love the bison!
