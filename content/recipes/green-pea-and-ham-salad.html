    <b>AuLait</b> - Just wanted to answer lovestohost question about what this salad actually is :) I didn&#039;t see a way to edit my description for a submitted recipe, but in our family its served as a side dish at barbeques, picnics, and potlucks. Its usually placed with the salad options. Enjoy!

    <b>Hennepin Dave</b> - I give this recipe high marks for its simplicity and flavor. The ingredients are ones I&#039;m likely to have on-hand in the pantry or deep-freeze.  It is good as a side in a buffet-style luncheon, or handy to-go lunch in a pita pocket.  It is a nice break from tuna or chicken salad. I will make this again.

    <b>hnossa</b> - I had horribly overcooked ham leftover and this recipe saved the day! This salad is delicious! It came together in under 5 minutes. I did use 1/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup mayo instead of 3/4 cup mayo and found that to be plenty. I also used 1 tbsp of dried minced onions (instead of fresh) which I found gave a pleasing crunch to the salad. I rolled this up in a tortilla and had a fantastic lunch! Thanks for this recipe!

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Sharleen Renee</b> - This is one of three recipes I made to use up the holiday ham.  It&#039;s a great quick side dish. I omitted the onions, but added celery. I also did a mix of Mayo and sour cream. I used cubed cheese and cut those cubes into quarters. My husband loved it. I could see myself making this again for a quick dish for a buffet or hosting a party.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Soria Aj</b> - I added boiled egg as well as garlic juice to enhance flavor.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Jackie</b> - I made this pea salad for a potluck and it was a hit! I doubled the recipe up too. The only thing I changed was I used canned peas instead of frozen peas. Great recipe!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>lovestohost</b> - This is a super easy to throw together salad. Per personal preference I&#039;ll probably cut the mayo w/sour cream if I make this again because I&#039;m not a big fan of mayo. Mr. LTH enjoyed this and so did I but I&#039;m not quite sure what it is? Is it a sandwich spread? Is it a side? I appreciate the versatility but I&#039;m not sure what I&#039;d make this as. THANKS for the recipe AuLait!

    <b>kanstrand</b> - I think it was the same time last year that I last tried this recipe because I love green peas and had ham left over from Christmas dinner and I just really loved how this salad turned out! I especially love that it&#039;s all ingredients I usually have on hand anyway:-) I think last time I made it I added a little bit if diced celery too to add an little extra crunch!
