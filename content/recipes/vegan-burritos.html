    <b>Kim</b> - All-in-all, this was a tasty recipe. My major ding to it, is that it can easily be made with much fewer steps. Cook the rice in 2 cups water and the 10 oz can of Rotel, and set aside. Then heat a skillet over medium heat; add the oil, onions, and potatoes. Season with the seasoning mix (but I wouldn&#039;t use the full amount listed. It made it almost bitter. Reduce the cumin and turmeric amounts by half, then season to taste from there. Add some paprika and chili powder too). Let that cook until potatoes begin to brown, then add in green pepper and garlic; cook a little longer. Add in beans until heated. Then you&#039;re done. Much easier prep, with fewer dishes dirtied. In addition to the romaine and spinach for toppings; I added the fresh basil as a topping (instead of adding to the potatoes when cooking), and some tomato slices. Turned out great! Thanks for the recipe!
