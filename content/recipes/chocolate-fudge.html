        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>APRIL40</b> - I have been using this recipe for 20 years.....to make regular chocolate fudge- use 2 tsp. vanilla-instead of the peanut butter. This recipe was sent to my daughter in Saudia Arabia (mails very well)
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>YENKOZ28</b> - Wow - did this work out perfectly. I let the pan cool in a water bath after stirring in the peanut butter. The gloss faded and after half a minute of hard beating with a big strong wooden spoon it went into the 8x8 buttered glass dish easily. It started to set pretty quickly and I used a hand-sized piece of foil to press it flat. A comment on the other review about the recipe not firming up - I instinctively added the evaporated milk by pouring in the whole can then remembered the aforementioned review and realized I the mistake. I was able to remove enough of the excess milk and thought maybe someone else might do the same hence this note.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>SAKLED</b> - This recipe was fast but didn&#039;t set up when I made it so I re-cooked it and it still didn&#039;t set up. Besides the stickyness it tasted ok but I was very dissapointed in this recipe and ended up throwing it out.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>CANDYLADY1955</b> - Chocolate Fudge was always one of mom&#039;s favorites to make now that I am a grandma myself i injoy the same thing&#039;s with my grandkids a they only ask for more you can&#039;t just eat one!!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>ALANAOLSON</b> - This is some really good fudge and fairly quick and easy. As a plus if you grease the pan with real butter this recipe is soy-free. I am allergic to soy so this fudge is some of the only chocolate I can eat.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>American in Sweden</b> - It tasted ok. But it never set. It was like a big blob of chocolate mess.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>athf092</b> - I&#039;ve been teaching myself how to make fudge lately and I&#039;ve found that it can be really tricky. If you&#039;ve never made fudge before this is not the recipe for you. Beginners should look for a recipe that contains either marshmallows marshmallow fluff or cornsyrup. If you really want to make this recipe you need to do your research and go through a couple botched batches of fudge to make it work. For starters beating the fudge at the end is very important. Under or over beating will both lead to big problems in terms of how your fudge sets up. Do not stop beating until the moment the fudge starts to look less shiny then stop immediately and pour it out.

    <b>RAYSHOUSE1</b> - I think the wording should be changed I got confused with how you said bring it to a hard boil i did and it burned i might try it again now that i reread the recipe.
