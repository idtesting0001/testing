    <b>originalpoppyseed</b> - So refreshing and pretty!! I used soda instead of tonic since that was all I had. Next time I think I&#039;ll try infusing the vodka a bit longer to get a stronger lavender flavour. As it is these first few sips - refreshing lemony and a slight lavender aftertaste that I wish was just a bit stronger - maybe my lavender is weak! Definitely will try this again!
