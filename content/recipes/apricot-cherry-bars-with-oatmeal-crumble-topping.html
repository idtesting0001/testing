    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>PHUXTABLE</b> - Very sweet. The overwhelming sweetness overpowered the natural sweetness of the apricots and the delicious tart dried cherries. Not something I would make again. But I give it 2 stars because all the ladies in my bible study wanted the recipe! Tastes are different.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>DTSCEP</b> - I really hate to be the first to review a recipe and give a bad review but my family just didn&#039;t like these. The crust/topping was good but the end result was just too gooey and sweet for us.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>padutchy2</b> - I thought that it was delicious! But mine came out very crumbly and was hard to cut into small pieces. It can also get quite expensive to make because of the cost of nuts and dried fruit.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>American</b> - Yummmy. &amp; I did not add the brown sugar or any sugar.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Liv</b> - I cut down the sugar but I was still the only one who ate more than one piece. Just not all that great. Might try again with just cherries or just apricots.
    </li>
        </ul>
