    <b>MOMOTEXAS</b> - quick and easy, I did use leftover homemade chili, and added chopped onions, and a little mustard. great idea putting them in the oven. thank you for the idea :)
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>danapirtle</b> - I make these only I use soft tortilla shells. They get ate up faster than just a regular hot dog and bun. Husband will crave them at times! There is no need to boil first
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>thedailygourmet</b> - I&#039;ve never had a baked hot dog before. This was a notch up from microwaved hot dogs. I really liked the texture of the hot dog bun too!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>jellyman93</b> - This was a great change to serving the Chili Dogs. I waited to put the onions on before serving kids don&#039;t like onions on Chili Dogs. Thanks for the idea.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>LT63</b> - Absolutely delicious but I did add diced onions while baking.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Michael Flory</b> - This makes for nicely firm buns but as others have said - a little mustard would probably enhance the flavor.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Courtney Servantes</b> - It doesn&#039;t get any easier than this! We loved this and have made it 3 times in the last month. The buns get toasted/crunchy and they hold up well - even the next day!! My son even took one for his lunch. So easy to add toppings of choice. I passed this recipe along and they too enjoyed it. Thanks so much for a simple but tasty pleaser!!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Amanda Devers</b> - What a great alternative to plan ol&#039; regular boiled or grilled hotdogs.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Lisa Altmiller</b> - Wow, were these yummy!  I needed a quick and easy weeknight meal, and this fit the bill.  The Hormel chili and the hot dogs were a perfect combo.  They smelled so good while cooking in the oven and tasted as good as they smelled.  The toasted buns are such a nice touch!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Yaavie Aiwe</b> - We did not care for the toasted bun and the soggy inside:/
