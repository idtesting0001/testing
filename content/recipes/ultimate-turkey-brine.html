    <b>Victoria</b> - This is my second attempt at brining. Once you get the hang of it(like most things)....it&#039;s so simple! My daughter doesn&#039;t usually like turkey because it&#039;s usually dry. But after the first turkey.....she was like &quot;MoM! You have to make it like this FOREVER&quot; it was so good. Can&#039;t wait to see how this one comes out. Thanks for the garlic idea too!

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>plasmazombie</b> - I also included 1 tbs. oregano and 3 cloves of garlic. Perfect turkey.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>stevemax</b> - Good stuff. We soaked our bird in this for about 24 hours. I rubbed olive oil on the turkey and put black pepper on it before I indirect grilled it on my Weber kettle grill. Absolutely fantastic!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>LSterritt</b> - THE BEST brine I&#039;ve ever used. All of my guests said the turkey was the best one they&#039;d ever had (8 guests)!! After brining I let the turkey sit for 2 hours put butter under the skin olive oil all over the top with salt and pepper. Took an apple and put 1/2 in the neck cavity and half inside the bird along with 1/2 an onion fresh sage rosemary and thyme and baked a 20 pound turkey for 4 1/2 hours. The additional thing I do is take.all the giblets and the neck and put them In a small saucepan with salt and pepper and water. I use that to baste the turkey every 30 minutes or so and continue to add water as I use it back to the cooking giblets and neck. This makes the best gravy juice as well.

    <b>Tony Gandy</b> - Everyone thought it was the best Turkey they had ever eaten. I also smoked the turkey after a 10 hour brine. Smoked at low heat (160F for 3 hours) then raised temp to 300F unit thermometer read 170F. Was perfect.

    <b>Kurick Dumuzi</b> - I have used this on around 5 times and it is great I like to add two boxes of chicken broth and less water. So in all one gallon of liquid
