    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>MOUSIE206</b> - I liked this a lot. It&#039;s the closest thing I can get to a Maine lobster roll. You do need to let the flavors blend though.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>LINDA MCLEAN</b> - Leftover lobster would certainly be a lot better in this recipe but when we have lobster there are no leftovers. My kids and hubby really like imitation crab meat so this was definitely a treat for them and it did taste very much like the Lobster Rolls we had up in Boston last summer. Very good Erin!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>QCDude</b> - Try a crab(imitation or fresh)with shredded lettuce,mayo,and scallions on a 3-4oz.cresant roll topped w/shredded monterrey jack cheese.Heat @ 325 untill cheese melts.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>HouseCentipede</b> - An incredibly easy and fairly inexpensive recipie. An excellent way to use up your leftover mock crab from making sushi and so forth. The Old Bay seasoning is a must; if you don&#039;t have any pick some up as it is invaluable when cooking seafood.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>JU-JUBEE</b> - I didn&#039;t think this would turn out so great with such simple ingredients. But this easy sandwich mix is my new favorite seafood meal ever! I didnt use Old Bay Seasoning. Instead i used McCormick&#039;s Gourmet Collection Seafood Seasoning (basicly the same thing but more expensive. I coudn&#039;t find Old Bay). I made it the night before so the flavors blended for quite a long time. Once my boyfriend tried it he couldn&#039;t stop eating it. He ate 3 sandwiches!! (and he is not a big eater). Yummmm!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>KAITCH</b> - WOW! I cannot believe how delicious and flavourful these simple ingredients become! Like a previous reviewer said you MUST allow for the flavours to mingle (I left it in the fridge overnight). It is wonderful on any bread; I love it on a fresh croissant. Thank-you for this recipe! My search for delicious seafood salad is over!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>A cook in Arlington, VA</b> - This was surprisingly good! I made it only to use a package of imitation crab that had been lingering in the freezer for too long but I&#039;d make it again. My in-laws live in Maine so I&#039;ve enjoyed many lobster rolls over the years. This is a far cry from the real thing but it&#039;s an enjoyable sandwich in its own right.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>TAMI426</b> - This was interesting. I was expecting more flavor but it was pretty good.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>KJACKMA4</b> - These sandwiches were SOOO Yummy! I used less mayo more lemon juice and more red onions out of personal preference. Then I used fresh sub rolls from the bakery instead of hot dog buns. SOO Delicious!
