    <b>Amzngjen</b> - I tried to make this for my family but every single one of them absolutely hated it.  My husband was nice enough to point out that it basically called for me to put cocktail sauce on chicken.  If you have any love for your taste buds please show them some respect and steer CLEAR of this recipe....that is unless you like your family making fun of you for a full night :(
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Lois Lane</b> - This is quite easy and results in a &quot;different&quot; flavor as advertised. I wouldn&#039;t really call it barbecue because of the lack of spices but definitely a nice tangy sauce.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>SpinYouRound22</b> - Definitely not what you would expect for barbeque. I changed the recipe by dropping the lemon juice and horseradish completely. Instead I added (for a more bbq flavor) 2 ts brown sugar 1 ts worcestershire sauce 1 ts cayenne 2 ts paprika and 1/4 cup water yum!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>kellieann</b> - This was pretty good but a little bland. Next time I will double the horseradish and add garlic and onion.
    </li>
        </ul>
