    <b>France C</b> - These weren&#039;t bad, but salty, so I&#039;d leave out the salt unless you are using a za&#039;atar blend with no salt.  The cook time seemed off to me and my oven tends to run slightly hot, so I lowered the temp halfway between 325 and 350F. Even still, I had to pull them at 20 minutes and they were more than done and on the dry side.  I did like the low-carb aspect and they do have good flavor.
