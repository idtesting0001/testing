    <b>A Kosk</b> - Not that great. Smelled a lot better than it tasted. My boys choked it down and I ate one (and I do like quiche!) However I did not follow the recipe verbatim. I used a different pastry crust which was good. Nixed the nutmeg and added kielbasa sausage. Meh. Hubby didn&#039;t finish his either.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Ivette</b> - I would make this but I&#039;ll sauté 1/4 cup freshly diced onion and spinach in olive oil with some tomatoes and green pepper too. I&#039;m sure it will turn out great. They serve something similar at panera bread. Thank you!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Sugarplum</b> - I had some issues getting the croissant squares to fit into the bottom of the muffin tins properly but I&#039;m sure that was my fault for not rolling them out thinner. I thought they still came out looking Okay and they tasted good too.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>dltr</b> - Loved it. Didn&#039;t have spinach and added chopped turkey. I over filled the cups but used a cookie sheet under and was saved when a couple spilled over. I overlapped the croissant triangles before rolling to keep them sealed. Will definitely make again!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Amy McCullough</b> - Yum! This recipe was a huge hit but who doesn&#039;t love cresent rolls? I had more filling than rolls so I just poured the extra into the empty muffin cups. They came out great too. I added dried mustard to the egg mixture. I tried both spinach and broccoli(with sautéed onions) and bother were great.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Joephine Leyte-Vidal</b> - I made them and loved them. They were breakfast for 4 days. I only had chopped parsley and it worked.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Bmiller</b> - Easy to make. I made them without the croissants and added cooked sausage
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Heather Reed</b> - My 6 year old son loved it said he &quot;couldn&#039;t even taste the spinach&quot;. I used more cheese than the recipe called for &amp; chose grated mozzarella Colby Jack and parmesan. I used like actual bakery croissants.... however even with a well oiled pan (used coconut oil on the entire tin) it was difficult to get them out...I destroyed the bottoms on the way out. I think maybe some green onion would have made it a bit more flavorful as well.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>BP180</b> - I am not sure if I was supposed to use the prepared croissants that you buy in a bakery or the kind that come unbaked in a pressurized can. I used the already-prepared type and they were just okay. If you go this way don&#039;t bother trying to flatten with a rolling pin. I tore the croissants into pieces that fit in the bottom of my muffin pan then stacked another muffin pan on top of them (so the top pan was pushing down on the croissant pieces in the muffin wells. I piled a bunch of weight on top of the empty muffin pan so it would press the croissants flat. It worked pretty well although I had a bit of a hard time getting the finished products out of the pan. Overall these turned out a little bland. I like that they are light (no heavy cream or butter) but they need a little more seasoning. I did add diced red pepper and tomatoes so that helped.
