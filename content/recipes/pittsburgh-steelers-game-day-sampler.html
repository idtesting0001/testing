recipeingredient:
- "2 tablespoons butter"
- "2 sweet onions, cut into rings"
- "1 head cabbage, shredded"
- "½ (12 ounce) package medium egg noodles"
- "1 (16 ounce) package kielbasa sausage, cubed"
- "2 (12.8 ounce) boxes frozen mini pierogis"
- "salt and cracked black pepper to taste"
recipeinstructions:
- "Melt the butter in a large, nonstick skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion, and cook until very tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in as much cabbage as will fit in the pan, and cook until the cabbage is very tender, about 15 minutes. Stir in the remaining cabbage as the mixture cooks down."
- "Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the egg noodles, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink."
- "Stir the kielbasa into the cabbage mixture and cook a few minutes to warm. Fold in the egg noodles, then gently fold in the pierogis. Cover, and cook until the pierogis are hot in the center, about 10 minutes more. Season to taste with salt and pepper before serving."

    <b>Alice McGovern Matz Norris</b> - Great! Here in Western PA the cabbage onions &amp; noodles are usually called haluski. The addition of kielbasa makes this a one dish meal.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Lilcat</b> - Tried it, love it, will be making Christmas eve as it is easy and tasty.  I used the bagged cole slaw mix to make it even quicker.  Thank you for this, it is a keeper!

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>ABH83186</b> - Easy to make, love one dish meals, but it was a little bland. I expected this so I added some freshly diced garlic, and a little bit of Lawrys. Like another reviewer I boiled my egg noodles in beef stock. Also, as I was eating it, it occurred to me that with the egg noodles and the pierogies (which I lightly browned first) it was a little too noodley. I think I&#039;d like it better with some baby red potatoes instead of pierogies, and some more seasoning.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Stacy.Cape.Coral</b> - Really good! I knew this would make a lot so I cut it back to 1/2 bag of noodles 1 box pierogies and 1 LB cabbage with the smoked sausage. I didn&#039;t have a skillet big enough- so after frying the sliced smoked sausage I combined that with the cooked noodles in a large crockpot. I then fried up the cabbage and onions in the sausage drippings-- gave the cabbage a nice flavor added boiled pierogies until heated through. I combined everything in the crockpot &amp; left it on keep warm until it was time to eat. My husband said it didn&#039;t look like it would be any good but then RAVED about it! Would be good to take to a potluck as written.

    <b>Lee Prince</b> - Just finished it. Love it I added a little olive oil in with the butter. It seemed like there would be no sauce but it was perfect. I had to sub chantrelle mushroom ravioli my local store doesn&#039;t carry perogies. Looking forward to using the perogies.

    <b>mahoneybaloney</b> - Love it. I cooked the noodles with some Beef bullion and added broth to the cabbage as suggested. I can&#039;t wait until next seas on to cook it for my next steelers game at my house. Go Steelers!

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Volleyballmom</b> - This made a lot! It was really good. I had a big head of cabbage to use up and was looking for something different. I loved all of the components and it was very easy to assemble. My only oops was that I should have browned or boiled the pierogies first because they were fresh and just came out mushy in the pot. Next time I won&#039;t do that! Thx susiets &amp; thanks to my buzzer friend Molly for the recommendation!
