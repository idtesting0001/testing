recipeingredient:
- "1 ¼ cups finely crushed graham cracker crumbs"
- "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon"
- "3 tablespoons white sugar"
- "6 tablespoons butter, melted"
- "¼ cup cold water"
- "1 tablespoon unflavored gelatin"
- "1 ¼ cups pureed pumpkin"
- "3 egg yolks"
- "½ cup white sugar"
- "½ cup milk"
- "½ teaspoon salt"
- "¼ teaspoon ground ginger"
- "¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon"
- "½ cup white sugar"
- "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"
- "3 egg whites"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix the graham cracker crumbs, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, 3 tablespoons of sugar, and the melted butter together in a bowl, and press the crust mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch pie plate, pressing the crumbs up the side of the plate. Chill until the crust is firm, about 30 minutes."
- "Pour the water into a bowl, and sprinkle the gelatin over the water. Allow the gelatin to soften in the water for about 5 minutes. Combine the pumpkin, egg yolks, 1/2 cup of sugar, milk, salt, ginger, and 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon in a saucepan, and mix until smooth. Heat the mixture over medium-low heat until it almost reaches a simmer, and cook until thickened, stirring constantly, about 5 minutes; stir in the gelatin and water until the gelatin is dissolved. Remove the mixture from the heat."
- "In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until they form soft peaks; gradually beat in 1/2 cup of sugar and the vanilla extract until the mixture is glossy. Lightly fold the egg whites into the pumpkin mixture, keeping as much air in the mixture as possible. Scoop the pumpkin mixture into the graham cracker crust. Chill several hours or overnight."

    <b>Cara</b> - This was fabulous!  My family typically does not like pumpkin pie.  All four kids and hubby LOVED this.  We at it in one sitting. I did not use the graham cracker crust, I just made a simple pie/tart crust (w/ real butter of course) and pre baked it ahead of time.  The flavor was perfect, not too rich, extra light and melt in your mouth fluffy!  Yummmm! The pie was not as set as I would think it should be but I&#039;m sure it&#039;s either that I didn&#039;t cook/thicken it on the stove long enough or it didn&#039;t chill long enough.  My family was so excited to try it we only chilled it for about 3 hours.  I&#039;m making it again tonight and will chill it overnight this time, again using the pre-baked crust.  Now, how do I politely tell my in-laws that I don&#039;t want them to bring pumpkin pie to Thanksgiving dinner because we like this one better.  : )

    <b>ROHO</b> - Ginger snap cookies are a good alternative to graham crackers to add more flavor.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Amy</b> - A family favorite. I add some fresh nutmeg and increase the cinnamon. My family has been making this for years and I was glad to see it on Allrecipes.

    <b>MSR3953</b> - This is just what i was looking for! A light version of pumpkin pie. This is my go too recipes for pumpkin pie. Excellent flavor and texture.

    <b>Portann</b> - This was just delicious. I made for Thanksgiving today and my husband loved it. It&#039;s light and fluffy not runny. I used a pre-made shortbread cookie pie crust and sprinkled toffee bits on top. It&#039;s not as dense as regular pumpkin pie so it&#039;s great after a heavy meal. Thanks Mary!

    <b>Tony A.Smith</b> - my goodness, why are there all these great ratings! I&#039;ve been cooking for 30 years, and this recipe lacked significant instructions ; like cooling the cooked pumpkin mix, before folding in the egg whites, no wonder one person&#039;s came out runny. Another person said it was easy?
