    <b>Soup Loving Nicole</b> - Made as written and while the taste was good the appearance wasn&#039;t very appealing. My sauce never did thicken but maybe it wasn&#039;t supposed to. I made this as a sauce to dip my ribeye steak in and it went great with that. Next time I will add a little more cheese to get a thicker sauce.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>hurricanecook</b> - Recipe was just what I was looking for. I added mushrooms and asparagus and used tortellini as my noodle. Made as double recipe and it worked.
