    <b>KSICURA</b> - these are decadent! I don&#039;t like almonds so I just added more hazelnuts and a nice twist to make them prettier is to dip them in chocolate after they cool. Very wonderful recipe.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Anna G.</b> - This is a traditional italian recipes and as I&#039;m italian I post here my recipe! the process is the same the quantity of ingredients change (I&#039;m sorry I can&#039;t translate them in cups and spoons at the moment...): 200 gr almonds. 3 egg whites and 165 gr of sugar. Soooo good!! you can see my picture:)

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>trish palmer</b> - did not work boiling the egg whites. Try just cooking like a macaroon.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>GF mama</b> - Super good! I followed your instructions with another reviewer&#039;s measurments (200 g almonds 3 egg whites 165 g sugar) and they turned out beautiful and delicious. Everyone wants me to make more.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>LAURA </b> - These are the cookies I believe I&#039;ve been looking for. But First of I didn&#039;t quite understand over 5 cups of almonds. So after blanching fine chopping I used about a cup and a half. I proceeded with the recipe. Everything was fine. Second cooking them on parchment paper the bottoms burned and the tops were sticky. Also the waiting batter changed sort of seperated. What did I do wrong?
