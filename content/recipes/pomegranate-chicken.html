    <b>Carol</b> - This was very tasty. I had to cook the pomegranate mixture longer than 10 minutes to reduce it to 3/4 cup.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>bob</b> - It was the most tender moist whole chicken I have ever made.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Bridget Cotton</b> - Love the pomegranate sauce!! I use it to drizzle the chicken after serving too!!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>beancounter89</b> - The chase - the family loved it and it was voted a keeper. I used a Vidalia onion because I didn&#039;t want strong onion flavors fighting with the pomegranate sauce. The next time I will probably put two small limes instead of one big lime in the cavity and put the onion in between. I think I will cut them as well instead of piercing them with a fork. This chicken came out tender and juicy and there were no left-overs. I did cook the syrup longer than 10 minutes but that wasn&#039;t a tragedy. I ended up with a nice sauce to serve with the meat when all was said and done.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Crystal Shirley</b> - I used two chicken breasts in a dutch oven, but a whole chicken would probably be better. We still really enjoyed the recipe.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Nadia Szynarowski</b> - Was absolutely delicious. Just added more brown sugar than recommended to sweeten the acidity of the pomegranate juice. I highly recommend this dish!
