    <b>defunct999</b> - This was super yummy! I used pine nuts and regular crumbled goat cheese when I made it, and used less olive oil (about 1.5 TBS), and more spinach (about 1 cup).  I will however next time making this use less cheese as I thought it was too rich and somewhat over powering the other flavors.  Also, to make the prep easier with the quinoa, just add 1/2 cup water to the 1/4 cup quinoa, bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer for 15mins.  This way, the liquid absorbs on its own, and you don&#039;t have to drain it if you don&#039;t have a fine mesh strainer, much easier and quicker to do.

    <b>Dianne</b> - Oh my gosh!  If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I would!  This is my new favorite quinoa recipe.  Just a note, this recipe is for ONE serving.  I QUADRUPLED it to make about 4 – 5 servings.  I use pre-rinsed quinoa, so I followed the cooking directions on the box for 1 cup (dry) of quinoa.  I used pine nuts (which I’m crazy about) and parmesan cheese.  Next time I will add the nuts with the garlic and cook for only 2 minutes because I was afraid of the nuts getting too brown.  I did not quadruple the olive oil and lemon juice, though.  I still used only 3 Tbsp. olive oil and about 1 Tbsp. lemon juice.  And I used 2 large garlic cloves.  Thank you, thank you for this amazing recipe!!

    <b>Fit&amp;Healthy Mom</b> - What a great recipe! So easy to make and very nutritious. I used parmesan cheese and served with grilled halibut and steamed brocoli it was delicious.

    <b>Carrieh82</b> - TEN STARS!! This recipe could easily be served in a fine dining restaurant! I doubled the recipe for hubby and I and it&#039;s a very generous serving each. Such simple ingredients turn into an amazing dish that I would eat as a main course not just a side dish. I used half the olive oil and half the cheese called for (grated parmesan romano blend) to save quite a few calories and still get the same flavor. Because I cut out half of the salty cheese, I ground sea salt and fresh pepper to add just before I mixed in the spinach. Do Not leave out the lemon juice! It really sets of the flavors of this dish. Also, I used pine nuts since so many people recommended it and I&#039;m so happy I did. I could eat this once a week for years to come and hubby agrees!

    <b>Holly</b> - Such a great, easy recipe!  It definitely has a nice nutty flavor that would go great w/fish.  My husband thought it was perfect just by itself.  I tripled the serving b/c I have a big family &amp; it worked well for us, no leftovers.  I only doubled the olive oil &amp; cheese though.  Im excited to make this again!

    <b>SunFlower</b> - Amazing recipe I already plan to make it again soon! How could you go wrong with quinoa spinach and cheese? I used pine nuts instead of sunflower seeds. To be honest I don&#039;t know if I would have liked it that much if i had used seeds. Then again I&#039;m nuts on pine nuts!

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Laura</b> - Very easy and healthy! I used frozen spinach and red pre-washed quinoa. I steamed the quinoa, so I didn&#039;t have to rinse and drain it after. I also added some sesame seeds, walnuts, and black pepper. 
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Koko</b> - Great recipe, I&#039;ve been looking for a good quinoa recipe for a while and I made this after yoga class tonight and it was quick, easy and just what I needed. I used a mix of sunflower, pumpkin and sesame seeds which added some extra crunch and used parmesan instead of the gouda and it worked out great. I also used pak choi (Chinese spinach) as the store was out of normal spinach and I think next time I might add a few baby or sundried tomatoes. Thanks for the great recipe!

    <b>Diane442</b> - I made this tonight for dinner and we loved it!! It was fast and also nice and easy. I used shredded Parmesan and that worked fine, but I&#039;d be curious to try it with the gouda. The toasted sunflower seeds was a scrumptious and unexpected touch that added a delicious crunch. The cheese made things nice and creamy. I highly recommend at least doubling the recipe to get enough. I will definitely be making this again! Thank you for sharing!!

    <b>makeiteasy4me</b> - This was ok. We couldn&#039;t taste the garlic spinach or cheese....just the quinoa. I&#039;ll try it again but with more garlic and cheese. It has potential.
