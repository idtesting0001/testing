    <b>pomplemousse</b> - Very nice.  I wasn&#039;t sure whether the apples and pears needed peeled, but I did peel them.  Maybe next time I&#039;ll try without and see.  I can be an extremely lazy cook and while I wanted to make applesauce with pears to use up the pears I had, I really didn&#039;t feel like cooking it last night, so I put it in the crock pot overnight.  I eyeballed ingredients, mixed it up, and left it on low all night.  Woke up to a wonderful smelling house.  I chose not to puree this but just mashed it with a potato masher in the crock pot so I&#039;d get a chunky applesauce.  It worked perfectly, and this is very tasty.  I used rather tart apples so was worried I&#039;d need sugar immediately, but it is definitely sweet enough warm not to worry about it.  Very nice for breakfast with a side of toast!  Thanks for the recipe!

    <b>Cathy Higley</b> - I tried this recipe but instead of water I used pineapple juice. It turned out fantastic.  If you like it a little on the sweeter side this is the way to go. Oh, by the way,  the pineapple juice also acts as a preservative so the apples /pears don&#039;t turn brown.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Raymond</b> - The pears I used weren&#039;t quite sweet enough so I ended up adding maybe a Tbsp of sugar I also added about a 1/4 tsp of salt to accentuate the flavors. Loved the buttery smooth texture of this sauce!

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Arizona Desert Flower</b> - I added cinnamon to taste and a bit of lime juice for punch.  Perfect for all of us.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Mary Margerum Drake</b> - yummy  I love bananas, so I added one banana and the flavor really came through.  Homemade applesauce is much, much better than store purchased.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>deeneecee</b> - Super easy to make and absolutely delicious. I didn&#039;t process it though just mashed it manually because we like a chunkier sauce.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>nicole</b> - I peeled them and did the overnight crockpot idea! My children loved it!!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>VRCOOK</b> - My house smelled absolutely amazing as this sauce simmered on the stove.So easy and economical when apples and pears are in season!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Bïll Thompson</b> - Great recipe and so simple. Absolutely foolproof. I opted for not using my blender and instead just used an Irish Potato masher as i like my apple sauce a bit chunky. i added a wee bit more cinnamon because well I really like cinnamon.;-)
