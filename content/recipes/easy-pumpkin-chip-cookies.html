    <b>ahong21</b> - WOW. Addictive! I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and cut this recipe in half. It yielded 30 cookies. I also cut the sugar by 1/3, and used 1/3 cup brown and 1/3 cup white sugar for this halved recipe. I added a half a teaspoon nutmeg and substituted applesauce for half of the oil.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>MJP</b> - I just made these and the recipe yielded 81 good-sized cookies - not 2 dozen! I made it with 1/4 c oil and 3/4 applesauce and 1 c brown sugar and 1 c white sugar.  They are very cake-like, but good.  Very easy to make and took exactly 10 minutes.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Gretchen Michelfeld</b> - Definitely cut the sugar in half. You&#039;ll never miss it. 
I also made it with whole wheat flour and added 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. Yummy.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Faith Torsey</b> - just made it according to the directions (except I used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon)...it made almost 4 dozen puffed up big cookies...very good though:)
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Macy.Bark.35</b> - They were very spongy and the recipe made about 100 cookies! I would divide this recipe in half.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Renee</b> - Delicious! I used  a half cup white sugar and half cup brown sugar, a half cup oil and half cup applesauce and also half whole wheat flour. Super soft, perfectly sweet, and very easy. Made about 72 cookies.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Jenny</b> - I made these for Thanksgiving goodie bags. They were an absolute hit! Everyone was scrambling for more! I made them with one cup of melted shortening instead of oil. I wouldn&#039;t change a thing. Not too moist packaged up great and were melt in your mouth yummy.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>crusaderjenn</b> - I was disappointed because the cookies have an overwhelming taste of baking soda and powder.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Roxanne Cook Aldrich</b> - They were delicious!! Very easy to make..
