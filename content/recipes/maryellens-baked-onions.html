    <b>BNNYBTT</b> - Yummy. I only used three onions but kept the sauce amount the same. I also didn&#039;t have any fresh tarragon so I used a little dried thyme. I had to cook it a little bit longer but I wasn&#039;t using a clay cooker. Will definitely make these again.

    <b>MAEVEN6</b> - Good recipe and original. Great for those looking for inexpensive dishes. I chose to bake all day thought and they carmelized well. Used them on Matza as an appetizer and then on the baked potatoes for our meal. Flavor was wonderful.

    <b>Abby R.</b> - This is an awesome recipe. My family ate every bit of it and said I have to fix it again soon only next time make more. I did fix it again and put my steaks in it to marinate and they were fantastic.

    <b>Deb C</b> - Very simple and tasty this is a nice accompaniment to the main dish. If you don t have a clay cooker which I don t I would increase the baking time. Also I didn t have any fresh tarragon so I used some dried herbs de provence. It worked out great.
