    <b>Terra-Matris</b> - As a &quot;coconut-aholic&quot; I loved this recipe!!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Suzanne</b> - I too grew up in Newfoundland and these were a &quot;must-have&quot; during the Christmas season. My kids loved them especially when they helped make them. Thanks for sharing!!:)
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Peggy Esposito</b> - The cooked mixture was too soupy and would not roll into a ball to roll into the coconut.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Marie E Griffin</b> - Substitute the milk with a can of 370ml Carnation evaporated milk and then it&#039;s authentic newfie snowballs! Plus it taste so much better! This recipe is still pretty good:)
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>patriotone</b> - Not sure what I did wrong but the mixture is too loose to make into balls.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Cook wannabe</b> - So good. I also grew up in Newfoundland and was a treat to have these at Christmas. Thanks for sharing!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Kimmi250</b> - Found the mixture needed to cool longer than 5 minutes cooled mine for 15 minutes. I also toasted the 1/2 cup coconut then rolled the cookies into that. Mmm good!!:)
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Ness</b> - A Christmas tradition for many Newfoundlanders! Thanks so much for posting:)
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>cakemaker</b> - I usually make these with same ingredients but no cooking. Just put all in a bowl and use your hands to mix good then roll in coconut. I tried the cooked one today. The mixture is hard to make balls because it is too soft. I was able to do it by running my hands under cold water before rolling each ball. That helped. They are good and a little healthy with all the oats I tell myself.
