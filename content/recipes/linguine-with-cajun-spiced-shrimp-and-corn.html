    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>MommyDiva</b> - The eight ingredients starting with the garlic should be mixed together and let sit overnight in the fridge to marinate the oregano should be 1 tablespoon not one teaspoon (don&#039;t be afraid as it mixes through). The entire mixture should be heated through with the melted butter and proceed with the recipe. The garlic and red onion should not be cooked until translucent as this dulls the intensity of the garlic and red onion changing the final flavor. Also shouldn&#039;t take as much time as recipe states.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>JimcooksinVA</b> - This is a good beginning. I added a large can of whole tomatoes chopped with the vegetables a 1/2 half cup of virgin olive oil and double the amount of Cilantro and Spices. Instead of half and half I used white wine.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>PitBoss007</b> - I altered the recipe a little bit added Rotel Tomatoes and Chilies. Put a little kick in it. I did like this recipe and I will make it again.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Caroline C</b> - Changes I made: I marinated the shrimp in the juice of half a lime for a couple of hours; I cut WAY back on the amount of butter called for; I subbed regular yellow onion for the red and I used a couple of tbsps of McCormick&#039;s Chipotle Chile Pepper powder instead of canned peppers. This turned out great. Thanks!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>sdunc</b> - Another classic that I&#039;ve held on to. Be careful about the butter and you may want to use less pasta but other than that mmmm!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Chocokide</b> - This was delicious - I omitted the red bell pepper as I had none on hand. I would make this again but I think the sauce was not enough for that much linguine so I&#039;d double the sauce and leave everything else as is.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>MrsA</b> - Tasty but I think I would have made a roux first as the sauce is a bit thin. Also the color is beautiful but for more variation add green bell in with the red.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>mrs. kosmos</b> - I followed some of the reviewer&#039;s suggestions. I sauteed veggies in 1 T butter doubled onion oregano cilantro and chili pepper used 1 C half &amp; half and added a can of tomato sauce. Came out pretty darn good!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>BRG</b> - This was good but nothing really special about it.
    </li>
        </ul>
