    <b>eljaustin</b> - I can tell you by just looking at this recipe that it&#039;s VERY authentic (minus the bay leaves which I suspect Allrecipes put instead of the curry leaves). I&#039;m of Indian descent and this is pretty much how we make meat as a side dish to eat with rice. Here are some tips though: 1) Cube your beef really small (like 1/2 inch pieces) so that you&#039;ll get more flavor onto your meat. 2) Instead of lemon juice use 1 tomato chopped up to add a little acidity. Be sure to cook it down all the way. 3) You can use about 1-2 tsp of red chili powder as per your taste (ie. cayenne powder NOT chili powder for chili) instead of the green chili peppers or use a smaller amount of both. They have different flavors but both provide heat. 4) Don&#039;t fry your onions until crisp...just sautee until slightly brown if you want the flavors &amp; masala to penetrate the meat. 5) You can pre-cook your meat with ginger onions salt a little turmeric and green chilis in a pressure cooker to make the beef more tender.

    <b>Doonesbaby</b> - This was delicious and easy to make. My entire family enjoyed it- I only used 3 small green chilis and deseeded them. There was still plenty of spice and flavour.

    <b>Daphne</b> - I am originally from India and I have never cooked beef in my life before. I wanted to do something different for this New Year and I am glad that I found this recipe. I did exactly as per the recipe and it came out really well. Now you have awakened my beef taste bud!!! Again thanks for the recipe.

    <b>Elisabeth Thomas</b> - I&#039;ve tried over two dozen recipes from this website and this is by far the most impressive. I was stingy and bought a lower grade of beef which I won&#039;t do next time but despite the fact that it wasn&#039;t as tender as I&#039;d like (I also cut it a bit too small) the flavor was FABULOUS. I recommend not letting all of the broth cook off but instead adding the remaining broth to the coconut oil mixture. If you serve it over rice the rice soaks the sauce right up and it is so delicious! My husband and I like spicy food and will probably also add another chili or two next time. We&#039;ll definitely be making this again... and again!

    <b>Stephen Lesko</b> - I tried this recipe last night and was extremely pleased. I did substitute 1/2 cup fresh tomato puree instead of the lemon juice as one person who commented had suggested. I also have a bay laurel tree and a curry plant in my garden which made the list of ingredients even easier. I quickly photographed the finished product as everyone was more than ready to dig in and eat I&#039;m not a food photographer so please be kind.

    <b>greg&amp;lou</b> - great recipe! we added some veggies &amp; threw it in the slow cooker. Very tasty!

    <b>parndee</b> - i had never cooked with fresh curry leaves before and i must say that particular ingredient puts this dish over the top. i used double the amount. very good dish.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>MedinaChef13</b> - this was identical to the the indian resturant down the street
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Carolyn Brown</b> - The first time I made this realized too late that I was short on meat. So added a cup of brown lentils and adjusted the liquid a bit. It was a big hit with my guests and now I always add lentils. Wonderful flavor.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>M M</b> - This smelled great while cooking and I think it has the potential for 5 stars. However I used jalapenos and it came out so spicy hot it was hard to taste anything. This meal requires expensive ingredients and is a bit labor intensive so I probably won&#039;t make it again. If I do I&#039;ll omit the peppers and maybe have them on the side.
