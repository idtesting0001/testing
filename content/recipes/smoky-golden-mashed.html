    <b>SusieG</b> - They are delicious! We stock Idahoan instant potato packets in our house by the caseful! I happened on them while looking for something for the &#039;meat-and-potato only&#039; eater in the household. I wanted something easy to fix so that when I wanted something like rice noodles or pasta there would be mashed potatoes as an alternative. These are one of the best products I&#039;ve used. There are different flavor combinations and then you can jazz them up if you want to - cheese sour cream fresh chives or other herbs and of course bacon! The only tip I can offer is don&#039;t add all the water at first. It may have something to do with humidity but I always hold back a little and then see how I like the texture. I&#039;ve had the unfortunate experience of making them too soupy once or twice and learned that tip the hard way:D

    <b>Llhmel</b> - Simple to do and turned out to have a great flavor.
