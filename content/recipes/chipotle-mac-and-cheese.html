recipeingredient:
- "1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni"
- "3 cups whole milk"
- "½ cup butter"
- "½ cup minced onion"
- "4 cloves garlic, minced"
- "3 chipotle chiles in adobo sauce, finely chopped"
- "6 tablespoons all-purpose flour"
- "1 teaspoon paprika"
- "salt and pepper to taste"
- "2 cups shredded extra-sharp Cheddar cheese"
- "1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese"
recipeinstructions:
- "Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the macaroni, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink."
- "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)."
- "Spray a 9x13 inch baking dish with cooking spray, and place the macaroni into the bottom of the dish. Heat milk in a saucepan until hot but not boiling."
- "Melt butter in a saucepan, and cook and stir the onion, garlic, and chipotle chiles until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Whisk in flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, and let cook for about 3 minutes, whisking constantly to avoid burning. Whisk in the hot milk, 1/2 cup at a time, and stir in paprika, salt, and pepper. Bring the mixture to a simmer (do not boil), whisking constantly until thickened, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the cheeses, about 1/2 cup at a time, and stir until the cheeses have melted and the sauce is thick and smooth."
- "Pour the sauce over the macaroni in the baking dish, and stir gently to combine. Cover the dish with foil."
- "Bake covered until the dish is bubbling and the macaroni has absorbed some of the sauce, about 40 minutes. Uncover, and bake until golden brown on the edges, 10 to 15 more minutes."

    <b>Harmony</b> - Completely satisfied! Fairly easy to prepare even with a 12 month old at my feet. Super tasty and has a nice kick! I didn&#039;t change a thing on the recipe. Just used the 3 biggest peppers I could find in the jar and there was plenty of heat. Nice and moist too not dry at all like some baked mac and cheese recipes I&#039;ve tried.

    <b>laurie</b> - Yummy! I used the three chipotles but it may be to hot for the spicy &quot;novice&quot; wonderful!!!

    <b>DJNitro27</b> - This was a fantastic recipe. I jazzed it up just a bit by tossing some panko bread crumbs mixed with melted butter on the top and baking it for 30 minutes until it formed a crust. The mac and cheese had the right amount of spiciness to it as well.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Tara</b> - This was the ultimate comfort food. My sister and I made this together and weren&#039;t sure how it would turn out but all of the flavors ended up coming together beautifully. Some things we did a little different were using large shell pasta instead of macaroni which hold more of the sauce in the pasta. We also used half milk and half heavy cream used a can of chopped green chilies and topped the dish off with some shredded cheese the last few minutes of baking. It turned out perfect and very delicious... I definitely recommend trying this recipe!

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>J J</b> - I will never make regular mac n cheese again!!! This was SO good. I couldn&#039;t find chipotle peppers so I roasted 1 poblano pepper and used 1.5 teaspoons of chipotle powder. I also used 1/2 smartbalance half butter blend that was handy. Amazing lavor - thank you veggiegirly!!!!

    <b>Deanna Diebler</b> - I made this for our Memorial Day family barbeque.Everyone loved it. I used 24 oz.macaroni and doubled everything else (except the flour.) I prepared it the night before.And when I took it out to warm up a little before putting it in the oven....I took a little taste and thought NO ONE will like this.But after baking it for over an hour and a half (it was a big pan) it was flavorful.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>4LINDALOU</b> - Good recipe! I used 2% milk and it tasted great. The spiciness is a nice addition. Next time I think I may add some chicken too.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Chef Cee</b> - This recipe is very good I have made it several times and it&#039;s very forgiving and always tasty. I use a little more chilis than what this calls for as I love the heat. Reheats really well for leftovers.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>klh1010</b> - I was very excited to make this recipe because I love the taste of adobe peppers in food. However I was rather disappointed after making this mac and cheese. I felt like there was too much butter in it for one and two it needed some sort of processed cheese so it didn&#039;t separate from the butter. I will not be making this recipe again unfortunately.
