    <b>Josie</b> - I made this today for Thanksgiving tomorrow.  I used extra creamy Cool Whip with the softened cream cheese to lessen &quot;watering&quot; of whip cream and for ease of making ahead.  I also chopped several celery stalks to add texture as was suggested by another Reviewer.  I also used Raspberry Jello.  This Salad is fabulous.  I had to add a bit of orange juice to the fresh cranberries to get them processed.  I used heavy pulp and I have found a new BEST SALAD EVER!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>mrsbont</b> - This is the best cranberry salad ever! I make it exactly how the recipe states and have gotten rave reviews from everyone including my dad&#039;s family who is the ultimate food critic. Try this you won&#039;t be let down.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Betty</b> - Oh my goodness! This is the most delicious cranberry salad recipe I have ever had! I have made many different cranberry recipes over the years but this one stands a head &amp; shoulders above the rest. I used raspberry for the jello &amp; since I had about a cup of glazed pecans left in the frige I beat &#039;em up in the food processor &amp; dumped them in. Delish!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Maggie</b> - This is wonderful. I used canned whole cranberries so I could skip the sugar/pan thing. Next time I will use a red delicious apple; I used a granny smith and it was a little too tart. My mother used to make something like this and it really brought back good memories.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>COTTAGEKITSCH</b> - I make a cranberry salad/relish every year and this is my favorite recipe! The only thing I do different is to keep the whip cream mixture separate so everyone can add to their own to suit their tastes. I also add a cup of finely chopped celery to the salad...mmm
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Amanda D.</b> - I love this recipe. It has been adopted as a permanent addition to our Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners line-up and my family hasn&#039;t ever been big on Cranberry Salads in the past. Leftovers don&#039;t last long in our house! It&#039;s good enough to be a dessert! It&#039;s easy to replace the sugar with Splenda and the Gelatin with the Sugar Free kind and makes it a bit more diabetic friendly but doesn&#039;t compromise the taste.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>simpledinners</b> - Our entire family liked this recipe. I used what I had which was 1 box of orange and 1 box of red jello. I also used canned whole cranberries. After dinner we mixed the whip cream/cream cheese into the entire salad and added marshmallows and that added a lot to it. This was good as the recipe called or with adding extra stuff.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Heather Horn Gruber</b> - I am bringing this salad to my in-laws&#039;tomorrow! It sounds wonderful and tasty! I am always &quot;stuck&quot; with the Jello dish so this will liven things up!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Tammi</b> - This was a great recipe. Everyone in my family loves it. I made and took it to last years Thanksgiving at my in-laws. Before I left I had atleast three request for the recipe. This year I was asked to make and bring it with me again. Just follow the recipe. I would recommend black cherry gelatin but that is just a personal preference. This recipe is a keeper!
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Nadelle</b> - This was not a hit at all. The mixture is way to heavy to serve with a big dinner. Will not make again.
