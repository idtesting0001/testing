    <b>momofpickyeaters</b> - I LOVED this recipe!!!!  We love tomatoes so I added a 8 oz can of tomato sauce, and a can of diced tomates (drained).  Next time I will probably add more cabbage.  It was SO good my husband could have ate the whole panful himself!  This is the best recipe I&#039;ve found on here!!!

    <b>lillpup</b> - This was very good although I had to make many changes to match what I had in the fridge. I used ground turkey chicken stock cole slaw mix and brown rice jar tomato sauce instead of the V8 and a mix of curry and cayan pepper instead of the soup mix. But it was excellent my boyfriend called it &quot;a keeper&quot; and there is PLENTY left so I froze some for another night.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Heather Patton Harman</b> - Pretty good!  Good for a cold winter day.  I used real garlic, and skipped the onion soup mix.  I used tomato sauce instead of the juice cocktail.  I also used brown rice instead of white, so I had to add more water and cooking time.  I wish that I had used more cabbage.  So actually, I did change quite a bit, but that&#039;s okay; still a good base recipe that lends itself to adaptation.  
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Lorrie from Oregon</b> - What I loved most about this recipe is that it only required one skillet from start to finish. No browning in one pan and boiling in another. It&#039;s great for large families and limited time/energy. Very simple to prepare and 110% better than hamburger helper.
I substituted the hamburger for ground turkey and the beef broth for chicken but otherwise followed the recipe and the result was great! My kids loved it (even my 2 year old cleaned her plate)

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>CARBFUL</b> - This is an easy and comforting meal for a weeknight. I didn&#039;t measure anything, just sauteed some garlic, browned 92% lean ground beef, added shredded cabbage, a can of chopped tomatoes, water and beef buillon. Served over rice. Thanks for sharing this idea.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>CGG</b> - My husband and I enjoyed this very much. It was very mild so I added just a splash of spaghetti sauce and topped it with Parmesan and Cheddar/Jack Cheese. We will have this again on a regular rotation. Thank you for submitting this recipe.

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Jessica Paige</b> - Made this last night and as many other reviewers have said...great one pot meal! I like a few others used brown rice (what I had on hand) so I increased the amount of liquid. The only thing I would change for next time would be to put the cabbage in (and perhaps add a bit more) halfway thru the cooking process as I like it to have a bit more bite to it. My husband thought this was fabulous! Thank you BINGOMOMMA56 for posting this easy recipe!

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>CookinginFL</b> - Overall this was a great recipe. I used 3 frozen hamburger patties (Bubba Burger brand vidalia onion flavor) instead of the ground meat since it contains extra seasoning and is fairly easy to cook up. Also just so you know a 11.5 oz. (small can) of V8 juice is the perfect amount to use. Instead of white rice I used brown to make this a bit more healthy. Everyone in the family enjoted this some of us decided to add diced tomatoes and also thought that sour cream &amp; shredded cheese would be good to add as well. We all agreed that this recipe is a lot like chili/sloppy joe/stuffed peppers. This made for a great 4th of July dinner!

        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>Isabel Barbosa Velozo</b> - Not bad at all. I don&#039;t normally like cabbage but I liked this. My family also enjoyed it.
    </li>
        <li class="pl-4 py-2 text-gray-800 bg-green-100 font-medium md:text-lg rounded-3xl mb-2">
    <b>valechick</b> - Made as directed. This dinner was acceptable but I personally didn&#039;t find it great. It was filling and relatively cheap to make and it made a lot. Though I somewhat dread eating this for lunch for the next few days. The smell of it lingering in the kitchen reminds me of a cafeteria.
